Here is the **English translation** of Slide 8:  
**Structured Programming (Dijkstra)**

---

This slide visually represents the concept of abstraction layers in computing and structured programming, following Dijkstra's model. Here's a breakdown of the diagram from bottom to top:

1. **Computer (sz√°m√≠t√≥g√©p)**  
   ‚Äì The physical hardware.

2. **Machine A (A g√©p):**  
   ‚Äì "Implementation of machine A on the computer"  
   ‚Äì This is a software layer that provides an abstract machine on top of the physical hardware.

3. **Machine B (B g√©p):**  
   ‚Äì "Implementation of machine B on machine A"

4. **Machine C (C g√©p):**  
   ‚Äì "Implementation of machine C on machine B"

5. **User functions on machine C (Felhaszn√°l√≥i funkci√≥k a C g√©pen):**  
   ‚Äì High-level applications or user interactions built on top of these abstraction layers.

---

This layered model is key in structured programming, showing how complexity is managed by building systems in hierarchical, modular layers.


Here‚Äôs the **English explanation and translation** of Slide 9:

---

### **Structured Programming: Relationship Between Functions**

This slide illustrates how **functions are layered and interact across abstraction levels** in a structured programming model.

- **Felhaszn√°l√≥i funkci√≥k** = *User functions*
- **C g√©p** = *Machine C*  
- **B g√©p** = *Machine B*  
- **A g√©p** = *Machine A*

**Explanation:**

- Each layer (A, B, C) represents an abstraction level.
- Arrows show **dependencies or function calls** between layers.
- Higher-level functions (e.g., in C g√©p or User functions) **rely on or call functions** from lower-level machines (B g√©p, A g√©p).
- The layered structure encourages **modular design**, where each level builds upon the functionality of the one below it.

This concept is key in Dijkstra‚Äôs vision of structured programming ‚Äî to minimize complexity by separating concerns and using clearly defined abstraction layers.

---

Here‚Äôs the **English translation and explanation** of **Slide 10**:

---

### **Structured Programming: Transparent Functions**

- **Felhaszn√°l√≥i funkci√≥k** = *User functions*  
- **C g√©p** = *Machine C*  
- **B g√©p** = *Machine B*  
- **A g√©p** = *Machine A*

**What the diagram shows:**

This slide builds on the previous one (Slide 9) and introduces the idea of **transparent functions**.

- A function in **Machine A** (highlighted in green) is being accessed **directly** by functions in **higher-level layers** (Machine B and C, even user functions).
- This direct dependency breaks the **ideal abstraction boundary**.
- In structured programming, this is considered **bad practice**, because:
  - It violates encapsulation.
  - It increases **tight coupling**.
  - It makes **code harder to maintain** and test.

**"Transparent"** here means the function is exposed in such a way that it allows unintended access across layers.

---

Here‚Äôs the **English translation and explanation** of **Slide 11**:

---

### **Structured Programming: Violation of Layered Structure**

- **Felhaszn√°l√≥i funkci√≥k** = *User functions*  
- **C g√©p** = *Machine C*  
- **B g√©p** = *Machine B*  
- **A g√©p** = *Machine A*

---

### üö® Violation Illustrated:
The red arrow shows a **direct call from a higher-level function in Machine B** to a **lower-level internal function in Machine A**, **skipping its own layer** (B ‚Üí A instead of B ‚Üí B ‚Üí A).

---

### ‚ùå Why This Is a Problem:

- **Breaks modular design**: Each layer should only interact with the one directly below it.
- **Increases coupling**: Makes future changes or testing harder.
- **Reduces maintainability**: Understanding and debugging becomes more complex.
- **Defeats abstraction**: The whole point of layered architecture is lost.

---

This slide is emphasizing the importance of **strict layering** in structured programming ‚Äî where **each layer should only rely on the one directly beneath it**.


Here‚Äôs the **English translation and interpretation** of **Slide 12**:

---

### **Modular Programming**

The image shows colored **puzzle pieces**, symbolizing how different parts of a program (modules) fit together.

---

### üß© Concept:

- Each **module** represents a **self-contained piece of functionality**.
- Like puzzle pieces, **modules should fit together cleanly** through well-defined interfaces.
- **Modular programming** encourages:
  - **Separation of concerns**
  - **Maintainability**
  - **Reusability**
  - **Ease of testing and debugging**

---

It‚Äôs a visual metaphor: **well-designed modules are like puzzle pieces**‚Äîdistinct in function but integral to the complete picture (software system).

Here‚Äôs the **English translation and explanation** of **Slide 13**:

---

### **Model-Based Software Design**

The diagram shows two domains:

- **Model Space (Modell t√©r)**  
- **Reality (Val√≥s√°g)**  

---

#### üí° Elements & Arrows:

1. **Feladat modell** = *Task Model*  
   - Represents what the system should do (requirements).
   - Created through **modeling** from real-world systems that satisfy requirements.

2. **Implement√°ci√≥s modell** = *Implementation Model*  
   - Describes how the system will be implemented.
   - Developed from the task model through **design**.

3. **K√∂vetelm√©nyeket kiel√©g√≠t≈ë rendszerek** = *Requirement-Satisfying Systems*  
   - Real systems that fulfill user or business requirements.

4. **Megval√≥s√≠that√≥ rendszerek** = *Implementable Systems*  
   - Systems that can be realistically implemented given technical constraints.

---

#### üîÑ Process Flow:

- Real systems (bottom) are **modeled** into the **task model** (top-left).
- The task model is used for **designing** the implementation model (top-right).
- That implementation model is then **implemented** into a real system (bottom-right).
- The intersection point (green dot) shows where requirements meet feasibility.

---

This slide introduces how **software engineering bridges the gap between the real world and code** via modeling and abstraction.

### **The C++ Programming Language**

#### üîπ C++ is an extension of the C programming language:
- For **object-oriented programming (OOP)**
- For **generic programming** (template-based development)
- With **standard container templates** (STL ‚Äì Standard Template Library)

#### üîπ Characteristics of C++:
- Contains **fewer than 50 keywords**
- **No other programming language has more operators**

---

This slide highlights C++‚Äôs power through its features: OOP, templates, and STL, while also noting its concise keyword set and rich operator support.

### **Namespaces in C++**

#### üîπ Creating a Namespace

```cpp
namespace mySpace {
    int myVariable;
}
```

---

### üß† Explanation:

This slide shows how to **define a namespace** in C++ using the `namespace` keyword.

- `mySpace` is the **namespace name**.
- `myVariable` is a variable **declared inside** that namespace.

You would access it like this:

```cpp
mySpace::myVariable;
```

Namespaces help **avoid name conflicts** in larger programs or when using multiple libraries.

---

### **Namespaces in C++ (continued)**

#### üîπ Referring to a namespace member using the scope resolution operator:
```cpp
mySpace::myVariable = 1;
```

#### üîπ Opening a namespace:
```cpp
using namespace mySpace;
myVariable = 2;
```

---

### üß† Explanation:

- The `::` operator accesses elements inside a specific namespace explicitly.
- The `using namespace` directive imports all elements of the namespace into the current scope, so you don't need to write `mySpace::` every time.

**Tip:** While `using namespace` can be convenient, it's generally best avoided in headers or large scopes to prevent naming conflicts.

### **Using Streams in C++**

#### üîπ Predefined stream types (from `<iostream>`, in the `std` namespace):
- **Input:** `istream`
- **Output:** `ostream`

#### üîπ Predefined stream objects (also from `<iostream>`, `std` namespace):
- **Input stream:** `cin`
- **Output stream:** `cout`
- **Error stream:** `cerr`

#### üîπ Operators:
- **Insertion (output):** `stream << element`  
  Example: `std::cout << "Hello";`
- **Extraction (input):** `stream >> element`  
  Example: `std::cin >> userInput;`

---

This slide summarizes how **standard input/output** works in C++, using streams and the `<<` / `>>` operators.

Would you like Slide 21 next?

Here‚Äôs the **English translation and explanation** of **Slide 21**:

---

### **Hello World! in C++**

#### üîπ Using the `::` (scope resolution) operator

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

### üß† Explanation:

- `std::cout` accesses the **standard output stream** from the `std` namespace.
- `std::endl` outputs a newline and flushes the stream.
- The `::` operator is used to **explicitly reference** elements within a namespace.

This is the classic **"Hello, World!"** program in C++.

Want to move on to Slide 22?

Here‚Äôs the **English translation and explanation** of **Slide 22**:

### **Hello World! in C++**

#### üîπ With Namespace Opened

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

### üß† Explanation:

- `using namespace std;` makes all names in the `std` namespace directly accessible, so you don't need to prefix them with `std::`.
- This simplifies the syntax, but it's generally best used in **small programs or examples**, not in **headers or large-scale software**, to avoid name collisions.

Would you like to move on to Slide 23?

Here‚Äôs the **English translation and explanation** of **Slide 23**:

---

### **Using Streams in C++: Example**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "The value: " << n << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

---

### üß† Explanation:

- This simple program:
  - Prompts the user to **enter an integer**.
  - Reads the input using `cin`.
  - Outputs the value using `cout`.

- `'\n'` is a newline character (similar to `std::endl` but without flushing the stream).

This is a basic demonstration of **input/output streams** in action.

Ready for Slide 24?

Here‚Äôs the **English translation and explanation** of **Slide 24**:

---

### **Standard I/O in C++**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a;

    // standard input
    cin >> a;

    // standard output
    cout << "a=" << a << endl;

    // standard error
    cerr << "There is a problem!" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

---

### üß† Key Points:

- `cin` ‚Üí standard input (keyboard)
- `cout` ‚Üí standard output (console)
- `cerr` ‚Üí standard error (usually console too, often unbuffered)
- `"Baj van!"` means **"There is a problem!"** in Hungarian ‚Äî often used for error messages.

This slide demonstrates all three core I/O streams in C++.

Here‚Äôs the **English translation and explanation** of **Slide 25**:

---

### **Constants in C++**

#### üîπ Constant variable:
```cpp
const double PI = 3.1415926536;
```
- `PI` is declared as a **constant** of type `double`, meaning its value cannot be changed after initialization.

---

#### üîπ Constant parameter variable:
```cpp
void Print(const int i) {
    cout << i;
}
```
- `i` is a **read-only parameter**. It cannot be modified inside the `Print` function.

---

### üß† Key Takeaways:
- Use `const` to protect values from accidental changes.
- It's especially helpful for:
  - **Parameters** you don‚Äôt want to modify
  - **Global or configuration values** (like œÄ)

Ready for Slide 26?

Here‚Äôs the **English translation and explanation** of **Slide 26**:

---

### **`const` and Pointers in C++**

#### üîπ 1. The data pointed to by `a` **cannot be modified**:
```cpp
const int *a;
```
- You **can change** the pointer (`a` can point somewhere else),  
  but you **cannot change** the value it points to.

---

#### üîπ 2. The pointer `a` itself **cannot be changed**:
```cpp
int* const a;
```
- The **value can be modified** through `a`,  
  but **`a` always points to the same location**.

---

#### üîπ 3. Neither `b` nor the value it points to **can be changed**:
```cpp
const int* const b;
```
- Both the **pointer is constant** and the **pointed value is constant**.

---

### üß† Tip:

Think of `const` as binding the **thing immediately to its left** (or right if nothing is on the left):
- `const int*` ‚Üí const data
- `int* const` ‚Üí const pointer
- `const int* const` ‚Üí const data, const pointer

Want to continue with Slide 27?

Here‚Äôs the **English translation and explanation** of **Slide 27**:

---

### **Boolean Type in C++**

#### üîπ Type: `bool`  
- The `bool` type represents **logical (true/false)** values.

#### üîπ Possible values:  
- `true` or `false`

---

#### üîπ Boolean constants:
```cpp
const bool igaz = true;   // "igaz" means "true" in Hungarian
const bool hamis = false; // "hamis" means "false"
```

---

### üß† Tip:

- Booleans are commonly used in **conditions**, **flags**, and **control flow** like `if`, `while`, and `for`.
- Declaring constants for logic can improve **code readability**.

Ready for Slide 28?

Here‚Äôs the **English translation and explanation** of **Slide 28**:

### **Function Overloading in C++: Functions with the Same Name**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int Abs(const int i) {
    return i < 0 ? -i : i;
}

double Abs(const double d) {
    return d < 0.0 ? -d : d;
}
```

---

### üß† Explanation:

This slide demonstrates **function overloading** ‚Äî defining multiple functions with the same name but **different parameter types**:

- `Abs(int)` handles integers.
- `Abs(double)` handles floating-point numbers.

The compiler chooses the correct version based on the **type of argument** passed.

---

Let me know if you‚Äôd like to continue to Slide 29!

Here‚Äôs the **English translation and explanation** of **Slide 29**:

---

### **Using Functions with the Same Name in C++**

```cpp
int main() {
    int n;
    double f;

    cout << "Enter an integer number: ";
    cin >> n;

    cout << "Enter a real number: ";
    cin >> f;

    cout << "The absolute value of the integer: " << Abs(n) << '\n';
    cout << "The absolute value of the real number: " << Abs(f) << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

---

### üß† Explanation:

This example demonstrates the use of **function overloading** from the previous slide in action:

- The user enters an integer and a floating-point number.
- `Abs(n)` calls the version of `Abs` for integers.
- `Abs(f)` calls the version of `Abs` for doubles.

The correct function is automatically chosen based on the **type of the argument**.

Would you like to go on to Slide 30?

Here‚Äôs the **English translation and explanation** of **Slide 30**:

---

### **How does the compiler choose between functions with the same name?**

1. **Based on the number of arguments**:  
   Can the function be called with the given number of parameters?

2. **Based on the type of arguments**:  
   Does the function require fewer type conversions than others with the same name?

---

### üß† In the previous example:
- You **can't decide based on the number of arguments**, since both functions take one argument.
- The compiler **chooses based on the type** of the argument:
  - `Abs(int)` is selected for `int`
  - `Abs(double)` is selected for `double`

---

This slide explains the **function overload resolution rules** in C++ ‚Äî essentially how the compiler decides which version of a function to use.

Continue with Slide 31?

Here‚Äôs the **English translation and explanation** of **Slide 31**:

---

### **Default Argument Values in C++**

#### üîπ In C++, you can assign **default values** to function parameters:
```cpp
void greet(string name = "Guest");
```

---

#### üîπ Rule:
In a function declaration, **once a parameter has a default value**, **all following parameters must also have default values**.

‚úÖ Valid:
```cpp
void func(int a, int b = 2, int c = 3);
```

‚ùå Invalid:
```cpp
void func(int a = 1, int b, int c = 3);  // Error: `b` must also have a default
```

---

#### üîπ If a function has `n` parameters and `m` of them have defaults:
- You can call the function with **n-m, n-m+1, ..., n arguments**.

---

### üß† Summary:
Default arguments simplify function calls and make your code cleaner, especially when most calls use the same value(s).

Ready to continue to Slide 32?

Here‚Äôs the **English translation and explanation** of **Slide 32**:

---

### **Default Argument Values in C++**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void test(int a, int b = 2, int c = 3) {
    cout << a << b << c << '\n';
}

int main() {
    test(1);        // Will print 123
    test(2, 1);     // Will print 213
    test(3, 2, 1);  // Will print 321
    return 0;
}
```

---

### üß† Explanation:

- `b` and `c` have default values.
- If only `a` is passed, `b = 2`, `c = 3` are used.
- If `a` and `b` are passed, only `c` gets its default value.
- If all three are passed, no default is needed.

---

### üîç Comments in Hungarian:
- `// 123 fog ki√≠r√≥dni` ‚Üí ‚Äú123 will be printed‚Äù
- `// 213 fogki√≠r√≥dni` ‚Üí ‚Äú213 will be printed‚Äù
- `// 321 fogki√≠r√≥dni` ‚Üí ‚Äú321 will be printed‚Äù

### **Memory Management in C++**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int *p = 0, *q = 0;         // pointers initialized to null (pointing nowhere)
    p = new int;                // allocate memory for one integer
    q = new int[5];             // allocate memory for an array of 5 integers
    delete p;                   // free memory for one integer
    delete[] q;                 // free memory for array
    return 0;
}
```

---

### üß† Explanation:

- `new` is used for dynamic memory allocation.
  - `new int` ‚Üí allocates memory for a single integer.
  - `new int[5]` ‚Üí allocates memory for an array of 5 integers.
- `delete` is used to release memory.
  - `delete p` ‚Üí for a single variable.
  - `delete[] q` ‚Üí for arrays.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Always pair `new` with `delete` and `new[]` with `delete[]` to avoid memory leaks or undefined behavior.

### **Parameter Passing by Value in C++**

```cpp
int a;
fv(a);

void fv(int b) {
    // function body
}
```

---

### üß† Explanation:

- The slide shows **value passing** in C++.  
- When `fv(a)` is called:
  - A copy of the value stored in variable `a` is made.
  - This copy is passed to function `fv` as parameter `b`.

---

### üß© Memory Illustration:

- Both `a` and `b` hold the **same value** (`00 00 00 01`), but in **different memory locations**.
- The memory address (e.g., `E00A010B`) is reused in the illustration to show the **content**, not the actual location of `a` and `b`.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Point:

- **Changes to `b` inside `fv` will not affect `a`** in the calling function.
- This is the default behavior in C++ for basic types like `int`, `char`, `float`, etc.

Would you like the next slide?

Here‚Äôs the **English translation and explanation** of **Slide 35**:

---

### **Parameter Passing by Value in C++**

---

#### üîî Important:
> **Whatever we do with the copy, it does not affect the original variable!**

---

### üß† Explanation:

- This slide emphasizes that when passing by **value**, a **copy** of the variable is made.
- Any modification done to the parameter inside the function affects **only the copy**.
- The **original variable remains unchanged** after the function call.

---

### üí° Visual:
The memory block labeled `b` is shown separately, indicating it's a **duplicate** of another variable's value (like `a` from the previous slide), but **not the same memory location**.


Here is the **English translation and explanation** of **Slide 36**:

---

### **Passing Variable Address (by Pointer) in C++**

---

#### üßæ Code Example:

```cpp
int a;
fv(&a);        // Pass the address of a

void fv(int* p) {
    // Function receives pointer to a
}
```

---

### üß† Explanation:

- The function `fv` receives a **pointer to an integer**.
- `&a` means "the address of `a`", so `p` points to `a`.
- Inside `fv`, modifying `*p` will **directly affect `a`**, since `p` refers to its memory location.

---

### üß© Memory Diagram:

- `a` is stored at address `E00A010B` with value `00 00 00 01`.
- `p` stores the **address of `a`**, so when dereferenced (`*p`), it accesses the value of `a`.

---

This demonstrates **pass-by-pointer**, which allows functions to **modify the original variable**.

Would you like the next slide translated as well?

Here‚Äôs the **English translation and explanation** of **Slide 38**:

---

### üìò **Passing by Address (Reference) in C++**

---

#### C++ Code:
```cpp
int a;
fv(a);          // Passing variable 'a' by reference

void fv(int &b) // Reference parameter
{
    // Function body...
}
```

---

### üß† Concept:

This demonstrates **pass-by-reference** using the `&` symbol in the parameter.

- When you write `int &b`, `b` becomes an alias (reference) to `a`.
- This means **no new memory is created** for `b`. It uses the **same address** as `a`.
- Any modification to `b` inside `fv()` **directly modifies** the original variable `a`.

---

### üí° Diagram Explanation:

- Both `a` and `b` point to the same memory address: `E00A010B`.
- The value stored there is `00 00 00 01` (which is `1`).
- There is **no copy** of the data like in pass-by-value; they are truly the same variable.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaway:
Use reference parameters when:
- You want to **modify the original variable**, or
- You want to **avoid copying** large data structures (for performance).

### üìò **Pass by Reference in C++ (continued)**

---

#### üí° Important:
> **"A reference directly reads/writes the original variable!"**

---

#### C++ Code:
```cpp
void fv(int &b) {
    // b is a reference to the original variable
}
```

---

### üß† Concept Recap:

- When a parameter is passed by reference (using `&`), the function does **not create a new copy** of the argument.
- Instead, it directly operates on the **original memory** of the variable.
- Any modification done to `b` inside `fv()` will **immediately affect** the variable that was passed.

---

### üìä Diagram Explanation:

- The memory address `E00A010B` holds the value `00 00 00 01` (which is `1`).
- Variable `b` is just another name (alias) for that memory.
- The value and address match exactly with the original variable (e.g., `a` from the previous slide).

---

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaway:
This is **pass-by-reference**. It‚Äôs used for:
- Performance (avoids copying large objects).
- Allowing the function to **change** the caller's variable.

### ‚úÖ Code Example Summary

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void NotChange(int b) {
    b = 2; // Passed by value - does NOT change 'a'
}

void Change(int *p) {
    *p = 3; // Passed by pointer - modifies the original 'a'
}

void Change(int &b) {
    b = 4; // Passed by reference - modifies the original 'a'
}

int main() {
    int a = 0;
    
    NotChange(a);     // a remains 0
    cout << "a=" << a << endl;  // Output: a=0

    Change(&a);       // a is modified to 3 (pointer)
    cout << "a=" << a << endl;  // Output: a=3

    Change(a);        // a is modified to 4 (reference)
    cout << "a=" << a << endl;  // Output: a=4

    return 0;
}
```

---

### üí° Key Concepts

- üü¢ `NotChange(int b)` ‚Üí **Passed by value** ‚Üí A **copy** of `a` is modified ‚Üí `a` remains unchanged.
- üî¥ `Change(int *p)` ‚Üí **Passed by pointer** ‚Üí The **original value** pointed by `p` is changed.
- üü£ `Change(int &b)` ‚Üí **Passed by reference** ‚Üí The original variable is **directly modified**.

---

### üß† Takeaway:

| Method       | What Happens               | Can Modify Caller Variable? |
|--------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| `int b`      | Copy made                  | ‚ùå No                        |
| `int *p`     | Pointer used               | ‚úÖ Yes                       |
| `int &b`     | Reference used             | ‚úÖ Yes                       |

Below is a comprehensive \~2,000-word summary of the translated slide content, organized into thematic sections. All material is drawn from the uploaded slides .

### Introduction

This presentation offers a sweeping overview of programming paradigms, the evolution of programming languages, core language constructs‚Äîparticularly in C++‚Äîand the fundamentals of object-oriented programming (OOP). It begins by categorizing paradigms from low‚Äêlevel machine code to high‚Äêlevel languages and structured approaches, then explores modular and model‚Äêbased design. A historical timeline traces major language developments, followed by analyses of popularity and energy efficiency. The latter half of the course focuses on concrete C++ features‚Äînamespaces, streams, memory management, parameter passing‚Äîand culminates with OOP principles, class syntax, and object lifecycle management .

---

### 1. Programming Paradigms and Early Languages

* **Command‚Äêdriven languages**:

  * *Machine code* (EDVAC, 1944; Assembly, 1954) provided the first programmable instructions executed directly by hardware.
  * *High‚Äêlevel languages* such as Fortran (1957) and C (1973) introduced human-readable syntax and abstractions over raw machine operations.
* **Functional programming** emerged with LISP (1958), emphasizing computation via function application and immutability.
* **Structured programming**, championed by Algol 58/60 and formalized in Dijkstra‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe structured programming theorem‚Äù (1966), promoted clarity through sequence, selection, and iteration constructs, reducing unstructured jumps.
* **Object‚Äêoriented programming** began with SIMULA 1 (1962) and Simula 67 (1967), introducing classes, objects, and inheritance to model real‚Äêworld entities and relationships .

---

### 2. Structured Programming and Abstraction Layers

Dijkstra‚Äôs model illustrates computing as hierarchical layers of abstract machines:

1. **Physical hardware** at the base (‚ÄúComputer‚Äù)
2. **Machine A**: software abstraction over hardware
3. **Machine B**: abstraction on top of A
4. **Machine C**: abstraction on top of B
5. **User functions**: applications leveraging machine C

Each layer offers services to the one above while hiding internal complexity. Properly layered calls ensure modularity and maintainability. Violations‚Äîsuch as ‚Äútransparent functions‚Äù that allow higher‚Äêlevel code to call lower‚Äêlevel functions directly‚Äîbreak encapsulation, increase coupling, and undermine abstraction. A strict layered discipline (each layer only calling the one immediately beneath it) guards against such breakdowns .

---

### 3. Modular Programming

Modular programming extends structured principles by encapsulating functionality into discrete ‚Äúmodules,‚Äù akin to puzzle pieces fitting together via well‚Äêdefined interfaces. Each module:

* Encapsulates a self‚Äêcontained set of functions or data.
* Exposes only necessary interfaces, hiding implementation details.
* Can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

This approach improves separation of concerns, reusability, and ease of debugging. Modules interlock through interfaces, allowing large systems to be assembled from interchangeable parts without exposing internal logic .

---

### 4. Model‚ÄêBased Software Design

Model‚Äêbased design bridges the gap between real‚Äêworld requirements and implementable systems through successive abstractions:

1. **Reality**: actual systems fulfilling requirements.
2. **Task model**: formal representation of what the system should do (requirements modeling).
3. **Implementation model**: design blueprint for how to realize the task model.
4. **Implementable systems**: practical software/hardware realizations.

Arrows indicate transformation processes‚Äîmodeling real systems into task models, designing implementation models from requirements, and implementing code from designs. The intersection (green dot) marks the meeting point of feasibility and requirements. This framework emphasizes iteration between models and real‚Äêworld constraints to ensure both correctness and practicability .

---

### 5. Timeline of Major Programming Languages

Key milestones in language development include:

* **1957**: Fortran introduces formula translation for scientific computing.
* **1958**: LISP pioneers functional paradigms.
* **1960s**: Algol and Simula lay foundations for structured and OOP.
* **1973**: C brings a powerful, portable systems language.
* **1980‚Äì1985**: Bjarne Stroustrup develops and releases C++ for object‚Äê and generic programming.
* **1991**: Python debuts as a high‚Äêlevel, readable scripting language.
* **1995**: Java introduces pointer‚Äêfree OOP on a virtual machine (JVM).
* **1998**: ANSI C++ standard (ISO/IEC 14882) stabilizes the language.
* **2000**: Python 2.0 adds new features to the language‚Äôs core.
* **2002**: Microsoft releases C# for the .NET platform, blending C++‚Äôs power with safe, managed code.

This chronology highlights the interplay of paradigm shifts and implementation platforms, reflecting evolving application domains‚Äîfrom scientific computing to enterprise systems and web applications .

### 6. Popularity and Energy Efficiency of Languages

#### Popularity (2022 IEEE data)

A composite score from sources like GitHub, Stack Overflow, and IEEE rates languages by usage and demand:

* **Python**: 100
* **C**: 96.8
* **C++**: 88.6
* **C#**: 87.0
* **Java**: 70.2
* **SQL**: 47.4
* **JavaScript**: 40.5
* **R**: 18.9
* **HTML**: 18.0

Notes: Python‚Äôs interpreter is written in C; JVM is implemented in C++; CLR (C# runtime) uses C/C++ and assembly .

#### Energy Efficiency (ML workloads)

A study measuring energy, time, and memory trade‚Äêoffs ranked languages by power consumption during machine learning tasks:

* **Most efficient**: C, C++, Java
* **Mid‚Äêrange**: C#, JavaScript, TypeScript
* **Least efficient**: Python, R, Ruby, Perl

This reflects trade‚Äêoffs between developer productivity and runtime performance; lower‚Äêlevel compiled languages excel in energy‚Äêsensitive contexts .

---

### 7. Core C++ Language Constructs

#### Language Essence

C++ extends C with:

* **Object‚Äêoriented programming** (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)
* **Generic programming** (templates)
* **Standard Template Library (STL)** containers and algorithms

It boasts fewer than 50 keywords but the richest set of operators among languages .

#### Namespaces

* **Definition**:

  ```cpp
  namespace mySpace {
      int myVariable;
  }
  ```
* **Access**: `mySpace::myVariable`
* **Using directive**:

  ```cpp
  using namespace mySpace;
  myVariable = 2;
  ```

Namespaces prevent name collisions in large projects but should be used judiciously (avoid `using namespace` in headers) .

#### Streams and I/O

C++ I/O is based on `<iostream>`:

* **Types**: `istream`, `ostream`
* **Objects**: `cin`, `cout`, `cerr`
* **Operators**:

  * Insertion: `std::cout << "Hello";`
  * Extraction: `std::cin >> userInput;`

Example ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Opening the `std` namespace simplifies syntax at the expense of potential conflicts .

---

### 8. Constants, Pointers, and References

#### Constants

* **Variable**: `const double PI = 3.1415926536;`
* **Parameter**: `void Print(const int i);`

`const` protects values and improves clarity for read‚Äêonly parameters .

#### Pointers and `const`

1. `const int *a;` ‚Äî pointer to constant data (data immutable, pointer mutable)
2. `int * const a;` ‚Äî constant pointer to mutable data
3. `const int * const b;` ‚Äî constant pointer to constant data

‚Äúconst binds to the thing on its left (or right if none on left)‚Äù aids memorization .

#### Boolean Type

* `bool` type with values `true` or `false`
* Constants: `const bool igaz = true;`, `const bool hamis = false;`
  Used in conditions, flags, and control structures for readability .

---

### 9. Function Overloading and Default Arguments

#### Overloading

Multiple functions with the same name but different signatures:

```cpp
int Abs(const int i) { /*...*/ }
double Abs(const double d) { /*...*/ }
```

The compiler selects based on argument types and required conversions .

Example usage:

```cpp
cout << Abs(n);   // calls int version
cout << Abs(f);   // calls double version
```

#### Overload Resolution

1. Number of arguments
2. Matching argument types (fewer conversions preferred) .

#### Default Arguments

* Syntax: `void func(int a, int b = 2, int c = 3);`
* Rule: once a parameter has a default, all following must too.
* Call variations: `func(1); func(2,1); func(3,2,1);` print `123`, `213`, `321` respectively .

---

### 10. Memory Management

Dynamic allocation with `new`/`delete`:

```cpp
int *p = new int;        // single int
int *q = new int[5];     // array
delete p;                // free single
delete[] q;              // free array
```

Pairing `new` with `delete` and `new[]` with `delete[]` avoids leaks and undefined behavior .

---

### 11. Parameter Passing Mechanisms

C++ offers three primary methods:

1. **Pass by value** (`void fv(int b)`):

   * Copy of argument passed; changes to `b` don‚Äôt affect caller.
   * Memory illustration distinguishes `a` and `b` copies .
2. **Pass by pointer** (`void fv(int *p)`):

   * Address of `a` passed; dereferencing `*p` alters `a`.
   * Enables modification of caller variable .
3. **Pass by reference** (`void fv(int &b)`):

   * `b` aliases `a`; no copy made.
   * Direct modifications to `b` reflect in `a`.
   * Efficient for large objects and in‚Äêplace updates .

Combined example:

```cpp
NotChange(a);   // a remains 0
Change(&a);     // a ‚Üí 3
Change(a);      // a ‚Üí 4
```

Results demonstrate how each method affects the caller‚Äôs variable .

---

### 12. Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming

OOP spans analysis, design, and implementation:

* **OOA**: Object‚ÄêOriented Analysis
* **OOD**: Object‚ÄêOriented Design
* **OOP**: coding and implementation

Three pillars of OOP:

1. **Encapsulation**: Data and methods bundled together; access controlled via interfaces.
2. **Inheritance**: New classes reuse and extend existing ones.
3. **Polymorphism**: Objects of different classes accessed through a common interface, enabling flexibility and code reuse .

---

### 13. Class Declaration and Object Lifecycle in C++

#### Access Modifiers

* `public`: accessible to all
* `private`: accessible only within the class
* `protected`: accessible within the class and derived subclasses .

#### Class Syntax

```cpp
class store {
private:
    int i;
public:
    void set(int pi) { i = pi; }
    int get();
};
int store::get() { return i; }
```

#### Object Creation

* **Static**: `store s;` ‚Äî lifetime bound to scope, automatic cleanup.
* **Dynamic**: `store *ps = new store;` ‚Äî manual `delete ps;` required.
  Example usage:

```cpp
s.set(9);
cout << s.get();        // 9

ps->set(4);
cout << ps->get();      // 4
delete ps;
```

Understanding static vs. dynamic allocation is crucial for memory management and program stability .

---
