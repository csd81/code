Here's a **line-by-line explanation** of your C++ code:

---

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```
Includes the standard library for input/output operations (e.g. `cin`, `cout`).

```cpp
#include <fstream>
```
Includes the file stream library to work with files (`ifstream`, `ofstream`).

```cpp
#include <vector>
```
Includes the `vector` container class from the Standard Template Library (STL).

```cpp
using namespace std;
```
Avoids having to write `std::` before standard classes (like `cout`, `vector`, etc.).

---

### Overloaded `<<` Operator for `vector<int>`

```cpp
ostream &operator<<(ostream &os, const vector<int> &vec)
```
Defines a custom `<<` operator so you can directly output a `vector<int>` using `cout` or file streams.

```cpp
{
    for (int i=0; i<vec.size(); i++)
```
Iterates over all elements in the vector.

```cpp
    {
        os << vec[i] << ";";
```
Prints each element followed by a semicolon.

```cpp
    }
    return os;
}
```
Returns the modified output stream to allow chaining (e.g. `cout << vec << endl;`).

---

### `main()` Function

```cpp
int main()
{
```
Start of the program.

```cpp
    vector<int> intek(10);
```
Creates a vector named `intek` with **10 elements**, all initialized to `0`.

```cpp
    ifstream bemenet("bemenet.txt");
```
Opens the file `bemenet.txt` for reading using `ifstream`.

```cpp
    if (!bemenet.is_open())
```
Checks if the file was successfully opened.

```cpp
    {
        cout << "Cannot open file" << endl;
        return -1;
    }
```
If not opened, prints an error and exits with error code `-1`.

```cpp
    for (int i=0; i<intek.size(); i++)
        bemenet >> intek[i];
```
Reads 10 integers from the input file into the `intek` vector.

---

### Output File Handling

```cpp
    // ofstream kimenet("out.txt", ios::app); // append
```
**(Commented out)** Would open `out.txt` in append mode if uncommented.

```cpp
    ofstream kimenet("out.txt"); // overwrite
```
Opens `out.txt` for writing, **overwriting** any existing content.

```cpp
    if (!kimenet.is_open())
    {
        cout << "Cannot write file" << endl;
        return -1;
    }
```
Checks if the output file opened correctly; if not, prints error and exits.

---

### Writing Output

```cpp
    // for (int i=0; i<intek.size(); i++)
    //     cout << intek[i] << endl;
```
**(Commented out)** Would print each number to the console on a new line.

```cpp
    // for (int i=0; i<intek.size(); i++)
    //     kimenet << intek[i] << endl;
```
**(Commented out)** Would write each number to the file on a new line.

```cpp
    cout << intek << endl;
    kimenet << intek << endl;
```
Uses the custom `<<` operator to print the whole vector (semicolon-separated) to console and file.

---

### Optional Vector Modification

```cpp
    // intek.resize(15);
```
**(Commented out)** Would resize the vector to hold 15 elements.

```cpp
    intek.push_back(1224);
```
Adds the value `1224` to the **end** of the vector, increasing its size by one.

```cpp
    return 0;
}
```
Program ends successfully.
