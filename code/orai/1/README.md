Here's a concise summary of the **key takeaways** from the code:

---

### âœ… **Core C++ Concepts Demonstrated**

#### 1. **Pointers vs References**
- **Pointer (`int *p`)**:
  - Can be reassigned to point to other variables.
  - Needs to be dereferenced (`*p`) to access value.
  - Stores the address of another variable.
- **Reference (`int &r`)**:
  - Acts as an alias for another variable.
  - Cannot be changed to refer to another variable after initialization.
  - Automatically dereferencedâ€”used just like a normal variable.

---

#### 2. **Function Overloading**
- Two `beolvas()` functions demonstrate:
  - Using **pointers** for indirect parameter passing.
  - Using **references** for cleaner and safer parameter passing.

---

#### 3. **Address and Memory**
- `&variable` shows how to get an address.
- Pointer and reference can both be used to manipulate the same memory.
- Demonstrates how pointer and reference addresses behave.

---

#### 4. **Const Correctness**
- `const double d` makes a variable immutable.
- `const int *p` = pointer to constant data.
- `int *const p` = constant pointer to data.
- `const int &r` = reference that cannot be used to modify the referenced variable.

---

#### 5. **I/O Basics**
- `cin` and `cout` used for console input and output.
- Use of `getline()` (commented) vs `cin >>` for strings is hinted at.
- `cout << "\"" << s << "\""` shows how to print quotes around a string.

---

#### 6. **Common Pitfalls Avoided**
- Trying to write to a const reference or through a pointer to const is illegal.
- Const pointer vs pointer to const distinction is critical for safe coding.

---

### ðŸ”‘ **In Summary**
- Learn the **difference between references and pointers**.
- Understand **how to pass variables** to functions using both.
- Practice **const correctness** for safe and robust code.
- Gain insight into how **memory and addresses** are accessed and manipulated in C++.

Here are the **main takeaways** from this C++ program:

---

### âœ… **1. Structs and Namespaces**
- **`struct Doboz`**: Shows how to group related data (name and dimensions of a box).
- **`namespace doboz`**: Demonstrates how to logically group related code and prevent naming conflicts.

---

### âœ… **2. Dynamic Memory Management**
- **`new` and `delete []`**: Dynamic allocation and cleanup of arrays of objects.
- Helps when the size is not known at compile time (entered by user).

---

### âœ… **3. Function Design and Parameters**
- **Const references (`const Doboz&`)** used for efficiency and safety (avoid copying).
- **Pointer references (`Doboz*&`)** allow modifying dynamically allocated arrays from within a function.
- **Default parameters** (`int ujElemek = 5`) show flexibility in function calls.

---

### âœ… **4. Array Management**
- **`tombNovel`** manually resizes a dynamic array:
  - Allocates new larger memory.
  - Copies over old data.
  - Deletes the old array.
- Mimics what dynamic containers (like `std::vector`) do internally.

---

### âœ… **5. Box Geometry**
- **Surface area and volume formulas** implemented in code.
- Logical operations like checking if one box can fit into another based on dimensions.

---

### âœ… **6. Input/Output**
- Read user input to populate a list of custom objects (`Doboz` structs).
- Use of `cin`, `cout`, and string concatenation for formatted output.

---

### âœ… **7. Function Overloading**
- The two `belefer` functions show **overloading**:
  - One compares two boxes.
  - One compares a box with raw dimensions.

---

### âœ… **8. Separation of Concerns**
- Each function has a clear single responsibility:
  - `kiirDobozok`: prints boxes.
  - `felszinTerfogat`: calculates and prints surface and volume.
  - `tombNovel`: resizes array.
  - `belefer`: checks box fitting conditions.

---

### Summary
This program is a strong example of basic object representation (`struct`), memory handling, modular function design, and simple geometric computation â€” all wrapped in a reusable and extensible style via namespaces and function overloading.
