// Program 5_2
// Multiple if statements for computing balance 
//
// this can be cumbersome and inefficient. The program uses multiple if statements to compute
// the balance of a bank account after multiple payments and interest
// charges. The program also counts the number of payments made.
// we can reuse the code without having to write it multiple times.
// if we use a loop, we can make the code more efficient and easier to read.
