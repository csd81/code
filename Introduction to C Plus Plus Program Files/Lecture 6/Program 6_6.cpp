// sine is a trigonometric function that calculates the sine of an angle.
// The sine function takes an angle in radians as its argument and returns the sine of that angle.

// cosine is a trigonometric function that calculates the cosine of an angle.
// The cosine function takes an angle in radians as its argument and returns the cosine of that angle.

// tangent is a trigonometric function that calculates the tangent of an angle.
// The tangent function takes an angle in radians as its argument and returns the tangent of that angle.
// The tangent function is defined as the ratio of the sine to the cosine of the angle.
// The tangent function is defined as:
// tan(x) = sin(x) / cos(x)
// where x is the angle in radians.

//radian is a unit of angle measure based on the radius of a circle.
// The radian is the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc whose length is equal to the radius of the circle.
// The radian is the standard unit of angular measure used in many areas of mathematics.
// The radian is defined as:
// 1 radian = 180 / pi degrees
// where pi is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.
// The radian is used in trigonometry, calculus, and other areas of mathematics.
// The radian is used to measure angles in a circle.
// The radian is used in many mathematical functions, including trigonometric functions, exponential functions, and logarithmic functions.

// e is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828.
// The constant e is the base of the natural logarithm.

// natural logarithm is a logarithm with base e.
// The natural logarithm is denoted by the symbol ln.
// The natural logarithm is the inverse of the exponential function with base e.
// The natural logarithm is defined as:
// ln(x) = log_e(x) 

// the gamma function is a mathematical function that extends the concept of factorial to non-integer values.
// The gamma function is denoted by the symbol Γ(n).
// The gamma function is defined as:
// Γ(n) = (n-1)! for positive integers n
// The gamma function is defined for all complex numbers except the non-positive integers.

// complex numbers are numbers that have both a real part and an imaginary part.
// A complex number is typically written in the form a + bi, where a is the real part, b is the imaginary part, and i is the imaginary unit.
// The imaginary unit i is defined as the square root of -1.

// absolute value is a mathematical function that returns the non-negative value of a number.
// The absolute value of a number is the distance of that number from zero on the number line.
// The absolute value is denoted by the symbol |x|, where x is the number.
