**Scopes in C++**

- **Global**  
- **Namespace**  
- **File**  
- **Class**  
- **Object**  
- **Function**  
- **Block**

---

Here is the English translation of the slide titled **"Glob√°lis hat√≥k√∂r C++" (Global Scope in C++)**:

---

**Global Scope in C++**

- Refers to the entire project consisting of multiple source files.  
- The scope of variables defined outside of procedures (functions).  
- Within a project, all global variables and global procedures are visible, usable, and callable without restrictions.  
- If we use the `extern` modifier, we indicate that memory allocation is not needed because it was already allocated in another source file.

---

Here is the English translation of the slide titled **"F√°jl hat√≥k√∂r C++" (File Scope in C++)**:

---

**File Scope in C++**

- If we don‚Äôt want our program objects to end up in the global scope, we should use file-level scope!  
- This can be achieved by using the `static` keyword.  
- **Motivation:** It prevents name conflicts with program objects of the same name in other modules.

---

Here's the English translation of the slide titled **"Oszt√°ly √©s objektum hat√≥k√∂r"** (Class and Object Scope):

---

**Class and Object Scope**

- An **object** can access its own  
  - variables: attributes  
  - see: encapsulation (previous lecture)  
- An **object** can access its **class**  
  - functions: member functions or methods  
  - **static variables**  
- A **class‚Äôs static member functions** can access  
  - the class‚Äôs **static variables**

---

Let me know if you'd like code examples to better understand how these access rules work in C++.

### üßæ **Code Summary (C++):**

```cpp
class store {
private:
    static int classVariable;
    int objectVariable;

public:
    store(int objectVar) : objectVariable(objectVar) {}

    int getObjectVariable() {
        return objectVariable;
    }

    static void setClassVariable(int classVar) {
        classVariable = classVar;
    }

    static int getClassVariable() {
        return classVariable;
    }
};

int store::classVariable = 0;

int main() {
    store s1(1), s2(2);

    cout << "s1.objectVariable=" << s1.getObjectVariable()
         << " s1.classVariable=" << s1.getClassVariable() << endl; // 1 0

    cout << "s2.objectVariable=" << s2.getObjectVariable()
         << " s2.classVariable=" << s2.getClassVariable() << endl; // 2 0

    s2.setClassVariable(3); // changes classVariable for ALL objects

    cout << "s1.objectVariable=" << s1.getObjectVariable()
         << " s1.classVariable=" << s1.getClassVariable() << endl; // 1 3

    store::setClassVariable(4);

    cout << "s2.objectVariable=" << s2.getObjectVariable()
         << " s2.classVariable=" << s2.getClassVariable() << endl; // 2 4

    return 0;
}
```

---

### üîç **Explanation:**

- `objectVariable` is an instance variable ‚Üí unique to each object (`s1`, `s2`).
- `classVariable` is a static variable ‚Üí **shared** among all objects of the class.
- `getObjectVariable()` accesses the object's own variable.
- `getClassVariable()` and `setClassVariable()` are static, working on the shared class variable.
- You can also access `classVariable` using the class name directly: `store::classVariable`.

---

Sure! Here's the **C++ code with detailed comments** explaining each part clearly:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Define a class called 'store'
class store {
private:
    // Static member shared by all instances of the class
    static int classVariable;

    // Instance (object-level) member, unique for each object
    int objectVariable;

public:
    // Constructor initializes objectVariable with the passed value
    store(int objectVar) : objectVariable(objectVar) {}

    // Getter for the instance variable
    int getObjectVariable() {
        return objectVariable;
    }

    // Static setter for the class (static) variable
    static void setClassVariable(int classVar) {
        classVariable = classVar;
    }

    // Static getter for the class (static) variable
    static int getClassVariable() {
        return classVariable;
    }
};

// Define and initialize the static class variable
int store::classVariable = 0;

int main() {
    // Create two store objects with different object-level values
    store s1(1), s2(2);

    // Output the object and class variables for s1
    cout << "s1.objectVariable = " << s1.getObjectVariable()
         << " s1.classVariable = " << s1.getClassVariable() << endl; // Output: 1 0

    // Output the object and class variables for s2
    cout << "s2.objectVariable = " << s2.getObjectVariable()
         << " s2.classVariable = " << s2.getClassVariable() << endl; // Output: 2 0

    // Change the static (shared) class variable using s2
    s2.setClassVariable(3); // Affects all objects of class store

    // Check how s1 now sees the updated static value
    cout << "s1.objectVariable = " << s1.getObjectVariable()
         << " s1.classVariable = " << s1.getClassVariable() << endl; // Output: 1 3

    // Update static variable again using the class name directly
    store::setClassVariable(4);

    // Output the values from s2 again
    cout << "s2.objectVariable = " << s2.getObjectVariable()
         << " s2.classVariable = " << s2.getClassVariable() << endl; // Output: 2 4

    return 0;
}
```

### üìù Key Points in the Comments:
- Shows the difference between **object-level (`objectVariable`)** and **class-level (`classVariable`)**.
- Explains why we use `static` for shared data and functions.
- Highlights how one object can change static data for all.

Let me know if you want a UML diagram or flowchart of this class behavior!

This slide provides a **UML class diagram** representation of the `store` class and its two instances, `s1` and `s2`.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown and explanation:

---

### **Class Diagram Elements**

#### **class store**
- **`- classVariable: int`**  
  A private **static** class variable shared by all instances (`-` means private).

- **`+ store(v: int)`**  
  Public constructor that initializes the object with a value. (`+` means public)

- **`+ setClassVariable(v: int)`**  
  Static function to set the shared `classVariable`.

- **`+ getClassVariable(): int`**  
  Static function to return the shared `classVariable`.

- **`+ setObjectVariable(v: int)`**  
  *Note:* This method is shown in the diagram but **not implemented** in the previous code. It would set the `objectVariable`.

- **`+ getObjectVariable(): int`**  
  Returns the object's individual variable.

---

### **Instances**

#### **s1: store**
- **`- objectVariable: int`**  
  Private instance variable specific to `s1`.

#### **s2: store**
- **`- objectVariable: int`**  
  Private instance variable specific to `s2`.

---

### üîç **Purpose of Diagram**
This UML class diagram visually shows:
- The separation between **class-level (static)** and **object-level** members.
- That both `s1` and `s2` share the same class definition but have their own individual `objectVariable`.
- That all instances share the same `classVariable`.

 

### **Namespace in C++**

- A portion of the source code enclosed in a named block.  
- Placing program objects (variables, functions, classes) into namespaces is simple.  
- A namespace can be continued as many times as needed.  
- Identical names can exist in different namespaces.  
- **Syntax:**
  ```cpp
  namespace namespace_name {
      declarations and definitions
  };
  ```

---

Namespaces help organize code and avoid name collisions, especially in larger projects or when integrating third-party libraries.

Let me know if you want an example showing how to use namespaces in practice!

Here's the English translation of the slide titled **"N√©vt√©r folytat√°s C++"** (Namespace continuation in C++):

---

### **Namespace ‚Äì Continued in C++**

- **Namespaces can be nested.**
  ```cpp
  namespace X {
      int a;
      namespace Y {
          int a;
      };
  };
  ```

- **Access with scope resolution operator:**  
  `X::Y::a`

- **The global scope is also a namespace.**  
  You can refer to it like this:  
  `::szamol(7, 5);` (calls `szamol` from global scope)

---

This shows how you can organize code hierarchically using nested namespaces and also how to refer to variables/functions at various scope levels, including the global one.


---

### **Namespace ‚Äì Continued in C++**

- You don't always have to write the full path  
  (e.g., `X::Y::a`)
- You can **expand** a namespace with the `using` directive.
- **Syntax:**
  ```cpp
  using namespace namespace_name;
  ```
- **Examples:**
  ```cpp
  using namespace X;
  using namespace X::Y;
  ```
- **You can also expose individual elements of a namespace:**
  ```cpp
  using X::bekeres();
  ```

---

üí° This is especially useful for making code cleaner and avoiding repetitive namespace qualifiers, but should be used with caution in header files to avoid name clashes.

Would you like a code snippet showing both full and `using`-based namespace usage?

This slide shows a **C++ namespace example**, demonstrating how to use functions with the same name from different namespaces, and how to resolve conflicts using `using`.

---

### ‚úÖ **Corrected and Commented Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Define namespace A with function fv()
namespace A {
    int fv() {
        return 1;
    }
}

// Define namespace B with a function of the same name
namespace B {
    int fv() {
        return 2;
    }
}

// Continue namespace A and define fv2() that calls A::fv()
namespace A {
    int fv2() {
        return fv(); // Calls A::fv()
    }
}

int main() {
    using B::fv;     // Bring B::fv into scope (overrides A::fv for now)
    using A::fv2;    // Bring A::fv2 into scope

    int i = fv() + fv2(); // fv() resolves to B::fv ‚Üí 2
                          // fv2() resolves to A::fv2 ‚Üí A::fv() ‚Üí 1
                          // Total = 2 + 1 = 3

    std::cout << i; // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

---

### üß† **Explanation:**

- `namespace A` and `namespace B` both define a function named `fv()`.
- In `main()`, `using B::fv;` makes **B::fv** the active version in scope.
- `fv2()` is defined in A and internally calls A‚Äôs own `fv()` because it‚Äôs in the same namespace.
- So:
  - `fv()` ‚Üí `B::fv()` ‚Üí `2`
  - `fv2()` ‚Üí `A::fv()` ‚Üí `1`
  - `i = 2 + 1 = 3`

---

Let me know if you want a visual diagram or a version without `using` for comparison!


Great! Here's the **same example without using `using` directives**, making all namespace calls explicit for clarity:

---

### üîÑ **Version without `using` directives:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

namespace A {
    int fv() {
        return 1;
    }
}

namespace B {
    int fv() {
        return 2;
    }
}

// Continue namespace A
namespace A {
    int fv2() {
        return fv(); // A::fv() is called here implicitly because it's in the same namespace
    }
}

int main() {
    int i = B::fv() + A::fv2(); // Explicit calls
    std::cout << i;             // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Why this is useful:**

- Avoids ambiguity and potential name collisions.
- Makes it crystal clear which namespace each function is coming from.
- Preferred in **header files** or large codebases to maintain clarity and prevent unexpected behavior.

---

Let me know if you want this visualized in a diagram or want more examples with nested namespaces!

Here‚Äôs the English translation of the slide titled **"F√ºggv√©ny hat√≥k√∂r"** (Function Scope):

---

### **Function Scope**

- **The scope of parameters:**
  - Valid throughout the entire procedure or function in which they are defined.

- **Parameters can be shadowed** by local variables defined within blocks.

---

### üß† Example:

```cpp
void example(int x) {
    int x = 10; // Shadows the parameter x
    std::cout << x << std::endl; // Prints 10, not the parameter
}
```

This slide emphasizes that function parameters behave like local variables but **can be hidden** (shadowed) by block-level variables with the same name.

Want a visualization or more complex example?

Let‚Äôs expand on the idea of **shadowing parameters in function scope** with a few examples and explanations üëá

---

### üîÅ What is **Shadowing**?

**Shadowing** means a local variable **with the same name as a parameter** (or outer variable) **hides** or **overrides** it **within its block**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Example 1: Basic Shadowing**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void greet(string name) {
    string name = "Alex"; // ‚ùó Shadows the parameter 'name'
    cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << endl;
}

int main() {
    greet("Taylor"); // Output: Hello, Alex!
    return 0;
}
```

üí° Even though `"Taylor"` was passed as a parameter, the function prints `"Alex"` because the **local `name` hides the parameter**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Example 2: Inner Block Shadowing**

```cpp
void display(int x) {
    cout << "Outer x = " << x << endl;

    {
        int x = 99; // Shadows 'x' from function parameter
        cout << "Inner x = " << x << endl;
    }

    cout << "Back to outer x = " << x << endl;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Outer x = 5
Inner x = 99
Back to outer x = 5
```

üìå Inside the `{}`, a new `x` is declared ‚Äî the original `x` is still intact outside the block.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Why It Matters**

- It can cause confusion or bugs if not intentional.
- Readability suffers if variables with the same name are reused too closely.

---

Want me to show you how compilers typically detect and warn about shadowing (e.g., with `-Wshadow` in GCC)?


Awesome ‚Äî let‚Äôs dive into **how compilers detect and warn about variable shadowing**, especially in C++.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Compiler Warnings: Shadowing Detection**

Most modern compilers can warn you when a variable **shadows** another. This helps catch subtle bugs early.

---

### ‚úÖ **GCC / Clang**

You can enable shadow warnings with the flag:

```bash
-Wshadow
```

üîç This warns you if a **local variable declaration hides another variable**, like a function parameter or a global variable.

---

### üìå **Example Code** (with shadow warning):

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void print(int value) {
    int value = 42;  // ‚ùó Shadows the parameter 'value'
    cout << value << endl;
}
```

### üîß Compile with warning enabled:

```bash
g++ -Wshadow -o test test.cpp
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è GCC output:

```
warning: declaration of ‚Äòvalue‚Äô shadows a parameter [-Wshadow]
```

---

### ‚úÖ **MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++)**

In MSVC, shadowing warnings are usually part of **warning level 4 (`/W4`)**.

To enable it:

```bash
cl /W4 test.cpp
```

It may not always catch shadowing like GCC/Clang, so tools like **static analyzers (e.g., Cppcheck, clang-tidy)** are recommended for deeper analysis.

---

### üß∞ **Bonus: clang-tidy**

A powerful tool that checks for shadowing and many other issues.

```bash
clang-tidy test.cpp --checks=-*,clang-analyzer-core.*,cppcoreguidelines-avoid-shadow
```

---

### ‚úÖ Good Practice

Avoid reusing names for:

- Function parameters
- Local variables in nested scopes
- Global or class-level variables

‚û°Ô∏è Use different names or naming conventions (e.g., `_param`, `m_var`, etc.)

---

Want me to give you a sample Makefile or VS Code task to automate this with `-Wshadow` and `clang-tidy`?

Here's the English translation of the slide titled **"Blokk hat√≥k√∂r"** (Block Scope):

---

### **Block Scope**

- **The validity range of block-level objects**:
  - It is limited to the block in which the object was declared (i.e., the area between `{` and `}`).

- **If a program object is declared with the same name in an inner block**, it hides (or shadows) the object with the same name from the outer block.

- **In nested blocks**, the compiler searches for objects **from the innermost block outward**.

- **Technical implementation**: handled with a **stack**.  
  (When entering the block, the object is created; when exiting the block, it is destroyed.)

---

Would you like a C++ example to visualize shadowing and lifetime within nested blocks?

Great! Let‚Äôs look at a clear **C++ example of block scope**, including **variable lifetime**, **shadowing**, and **stack-based behavior** as described in the slide.

---

### ‚úÖ **C++ Example: Block Scope and Shadowing**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x = 10; // Declared in the outer block
    cout << "Outer x = " << x << endl;

    {
        // New block starts
        int x = 20; // Shadows outer x
        cout << "Inner x = " << x << endl;
    }

    // We're back in the outer block
    cout << "Outer x again = " << x << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

---

### üìå **Output:**

```
Outer x = 10
Inner x = 20
Outer x again = 10
```

---

### üß† **What This Shows:**

- The inner `x` hides the outer `x` within its block.
- When the inner block ends, its `x` is destroyed ‚Äî this is the **stack-based lifetime** in action.
- The outer `x` remains unchanged and visible again after the inner block.

---

### üîÅ Visualization: Scope Stack

| Block Level | Variable | Value | Active |
|-------------|----------|-------|--------|
| Outer       | `x`      | 10    | ‚úÖ     |
| Inner       | `x`      | 20    | ‚úÖ     ‚Üê shadows outer `x` |
| Back to Outer | `x`   | 10    | ‚úÖ     |

---

Want to go further and add a function or loop block to see more variations?

## Inheritance 

Here is the English translation of the slide titled **"√ñr√∂kl√©s fogalma"** (The Concept of Inheritance):

---

### **The Concept of Inheritance**

- During inheritance, a new class is defined by **extending an existing class**.
  - The existing class is called the **base (parent) class**.
  - The new class is called the **derived (child) class**.

- The **derived class**:
  - Inherits **all members** of the base class.
  - Can **define new members**.
  - Can **override (or hide)** members of the base class.

---

Would you like a C++ code example that shows how inheritance, member access, and overriding work?

Here‚Äôs the English translation of the slide titled **"√ñr√∂kl√©s folyamata"** (The Process of Inheritance):

---

### **The Process of Inheritance**

- The **derived class** is a specialized version of the base class  
  (it contains additional members compared to the base).
  
  - Example:  
    *living being* ‚Üí *animal* ‚Üí *mammal* ‚Üí *dog*

- In case of multiple children, **inheritance trees (or graphs)** appear.

- A **derived class can take the role of its base class** ‚Äì this is **compatibility**:
  - A derived object can be passed in place of the base class.
  - A base class pointer or reference can refer to any of its derived classes.
  - Example: We can create an array or list that contains various mammals like dogs and humans.

- **Multiple inheritance**: a class can have **multiple direct base classes**
  - Supported by **C++** and **Python**

---

Would you like a code example showing polymorphism, inheritance trees, or multiple inheritance in C++?

Here‚Äôs the English translation of the slide titled **"Az √∂r√∂kl≈ëd√©s el≈ënyei"** (The Advantages of Inheritance):

---

### **The Advantages of Inheritance**

- **It promotes**:
  - Organizing capabilities into a **hierarchy**
  - **Code reuse**

- **Changes made in the base class automatically appear in the derived classes**
  - If we built every class from scratch, we would have to **implement each change manually** in every one.

---

This highlights two key benefits of inheritance in object-oriented programming:
1. **Reduced redundancy**
2. **Easier maintenance and updates**

Let me know if you‚Äôd like a practical example that shows how a change in a base class affects all derived classes.

This slide shows an **inheritance tree** (**√ñr√∂kl≈ëd√©si fa**) in Hungarian, representing a biological class hierarchy, which is also a good analogy for object-oriented inheritance in programming.

---

### üå≥ **Inheritance Tree (English Translation)**

```
           LivingBeing (√©l≈ël√©ny)
         /        |        \
     Animal     Plant     Fungus
      / | \
 Mammal Bird Fish
  /     \
Human   Dog
```

---

### üß† Interpretation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **LivingBeing** could be a base class (`class LivingBeing`).
- **Animal**, **Plant**, and **Fungus** would be derived from it.
- **Animal** would have its own derived classes: **Mammal**, **Bird**, **Fish**.
- **Mammal** would be further extended into **Human** and **Dog**.

---

### ‚úÖ Example in C++ (basic structure):

```cpp
class LivingBeing {};
class Animal : public LivingBeing {};
class Plant : public LivingBeing {};
class Fungus : public LivingBeing {};

class Mammal : public Animal {};
class Bird : public Animal {};
class Fish : public Animal {};

class Human : public Mammal {};
class Dog : public Mammal {};
```

This example reflects the structure in the diagram and demonstrates **single inheritance**.

Want me to show how methods are inherited and overridden in this hierarchy?


Here's an explanation and English summary of the slide titled **"C++ szintaxis"** (C++ Syntax), which shows how to declare a class with inheritance, including **multiple inheritance**:

---

### üìå **C++ Inheritance Syntax (Generic Template)**

```cpp
class className : inheritType ParentClass1, inheritType ParentClass2 {
    // New data members
    int newDataMember1;
    float newDataMember2;

public:
    // New methods
    void newMethod1();
    void newMethod2();

    // Overridden base class methods
    void overWrittenMethod1();
    void overWrittenMethod2();
};
```

---

### üîç **Explanation of Key Parts:**

- `inheritType`: the access specifier for inheritance, usually one of:
  - `public`: inherited members keep their access levels
  - `protected`: inherited `public` members become `protected`
  - `private`: all inherited members become `private`
- `ParentClass1`, `ParentClass2`: base classes
- New members and methods can be added
- Base class methods can be overridden (redefined in the derived class)

---

### ‚úÖ **Example with Real Values:**

```cpp
class FlyingAnimal {
public:
    void fly() {}
};

class SwimmingAnimal {
public:
    void swim() {}
};

class Duck : public FlyingAnimal, public SwimmingAnimal {
public:
    void quack() {}
    void swim() { /* overridden swim */ }
};
```

This demonstrates **multiple inheritance**, where `Duck` inherits from both `FlyingAnimal` and `SwimmingAnimal`.

Let me know if you want this example fully implemented or want to explore virtual inheritance to avoid diamond problems!

Sure! Here's your class definition with clear, detailed **C++ comments** explaining each part:

```cpp
// Declaration of a class that inherits from two parent classes
// 'inheritType' can be 'public', 'protected', or 'private'
class className : inheritType ParentClass1, inheritType ParentClass2 {

    // --- Private (or default) section: data members specific to this class ---

    // An integer data member unique to this derived class
    int newDataMember1;

    // A floating-point data member unique to this derived class
    float newDataMember2;

public:
    // --- Public section: accessible from outside the class ---

    // A new method introduced in the derived class
    void newMethod1();

    // Another new method added to extend functionality
    void newMethod2();

    // --- Member overrides: methods from parent classes can be overridden ---

    // Redefines a method with the same name from ParentClass1 or ParentClass2
    void overWrittenMethod1();

    // Another overridden method from the base classes
    void overWrittenMethod2();
};
```

---

Let me know if you'd like to turn this into a real example using `public` inheritance and actual base classes (like `Animal`, `Mammal`, etc.) or if you want to include constructors and method implementations!

Here‚Äôs the English translation of the slide titled **"Megjegyz√©sek"** (Remarks):

---

### **Remarks**

- In a class definition, **only direct base classes** need to be specified.
- The base class must be **defined before** the derived class definition.
- **Inheritance is not the same** as creating a member variable in the new class with the type of the base class:
  - In both cases, the base class is present in the derived class.
  - But inheritance features **won‚Äôt work** with member variables:
    - Access control (protected/private)
    - **Virtual functions**
    - Polymorphism, method overriding, etc.

---

### üí° Key Insight:

This slide warns that while you can include a base class as a **member object**, it won‚Äôt provide **true inheritance behavior** like:
- Virtual dispatch
- Implicit conversions (e.g., `Derived*` ‚Üí `Base*`)
- Access control propagation

Let me know if you'd like a code example comparing **composition** vs **inheritance**!

Here is the English translation of the slide titled **"Oszt√°lyok √©s forr√°sf√°jlok"** (Classes and Source Files):

---

### **Classes and Source Files in C++**

- In C++, each class is **typically stored in a separate file**
- The **header file (.h)** contains the **class definition**
- The **source file (.cpp)**:
  - Includes the declarations from the header using `#include "base.h"`
  - Contains the **implementation of member functions**

---

### ‚úÖ C++ File Structure Example

#### `base.h` (Header File)
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    void greet();
};
```

#### `base.cpp` (Implementation File)
```cpp
#include "base.h"
#include <iostream>

void Base::greet() {
    std::cout << "Hello from Base!" << std::endl;
}
```

This file organization improves code clarity, reusability, and maintainability ‚Äî especially in larger projects.

Here‚Äôs the English translation of the slide titled **"Jogosults√°gok v√°ltoz√°sa C++-ban"** (Changes in Access Control in C++):

---

### **Changes in Access Control in C++**

- When defining a **derived class**, you can specify how the **accessibility of inherited members** changes.
  - This is also referred to as the **inheritance type**.

---

### üîì **Possible Inheritance Types in C++:**

- `private` (default in C++)
- `protected`
- `public`

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Distinction:**

> The **inheritance type** and the **access level of a class member** are **two separate concepts**.

---

### ‚úÖ Example

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    int a;
protected:
    int b;
private:
    int c;
};

// Inherited privately (default if not specified)
class Derived : private Base {
    // 'a' becomes private
    // 'b' becomes private
    // 'c' is inaccessible
};
```

Let me know if you want a table or diagram showing how each access modifier behaves under different inheritance types!

Here is the English explanation of the slide titled **"Jogosults√°g t√°bl√°zat"** (Access Control Table):

---

### üîê **Access Control Table (C++ member access)**

| Access from ‚Üí                    | **public** | **protected** | **private** |
|----------------------------------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| From outside the class           | ‚úÖ yes     | ‚ùå no         | ‚ùå no       |
| From derived class methods       | ‚úÖ yes     | ‚úÖ yes        | ‚ùå no       |
| From within the same class       | ‚úÖ yes     | ‚úÖ yes        | ‚úÖ yes      |

---

### üß† Summary of Access Specifiers

- `public`: Accessible **everywhere** (outside, derived class, and inside class).
- `protected`: Accessible **only** in the class itself and **its derived classes**.
- `private`: Accessible **only** in the class itself (not even in derived classes).

This table is a great reference when designing class hierarchies and deciding what should be visible where.

Want a code example that shows what happens if you try to access each type from different scopes?

Here is the English translation and explanation of the slide titled **"Az √∂r√∂kl≈ëd√©s t√≠pusai C++-ban"** (Types of Inheritance in C++):

---

### üìò **Types of Inheritance in C++**

- **Inheritance can only restrict access**, it cannot make access more permissive.
- A **`private`** member in the base class is **inherited**, but **not accessible** by the derived class.

---

### üîÑ Effects of Different Inheritance Types:

| Inheritance Type | Effect on inherited `public` and `protected` members |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `private`        | Both `public` and `protected` members become `private` in the derived class |
| `protected`      | Both `public` and `protected` members become `protected` in the derived class |
| `public`         | Access levels stay the same in the derived class       |

---

### ‚úÖ Example

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    int pub;
protected:
    int prot;
private:
    int priv;
};

class Derived : private Base {
    // pub and prot become private
    // priv is inaccessible
};
```

---

Let me know if you'd like a visual diagram or code samples for each inheritance type in action!

Here is the translated and explained version of the slide titled:

---

### **Effect of Inheritance Types on Access Control in C++**

This table shows how the accessibility of members in the base class (`≈ës`) changes in the derived class depending on the **type of inheritance** used (`sz√°rmaztat√°s t√≠pusa`).

| Inheritance Type ‚Üí <br> Base Class Member Access ‚Üì | **private inheritance** | **protected inheritance** | **public inheritance** |
|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| **private** member in base class                    | ‚ùå Not accessible        | ‚ùå Not accessible          | ‚ùå Not accessible       |
| **protected** member in base class                  | ‚û°Ô∏è becomes `private`     | ‚û°Ô∏è remains `protected`     | ‚û°Ô∏è remains `protected`  |
| **public** member in base class                     | ‚û°Ô∏è becomes `private`     | ‚û°Ô∏è becomes `protected`     | ‚úÖ remains `public`     |

---

### üîë Summary:

- **Private members** of the base class are **never accessible** in the derived class‚Äîregardless of inheritance type.
- The **inheritance type** only affects how `protected` and `public` members of the base class behave **in the derived class**.
- **Private inheritance** makes all accessible members more restrictive (everything becomes private).
- **Protected inheritance** preserves access for the derived class but hides it from outside.
- **Public inheritance** keeps the original access levels.

Let me know if you want a diagram or a code sample that demonstrates each row of the table!


Ah, gotcha! You want the transposed table to **exactly match the layout** from your slide, where the `private` members of the base class are all marked as **"not accessible"** (like "NEM HOZZ√ÅF√âRHET≈ê") and grouped in one **vertical column**. Here's that version:

---

### **Effect of Inheritance Type on Access to Base Class Members**

| **Inheritance Type**       | **private (base)** | **protected (base)** | **public (base)** |
|----------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| `private` inheritance      | ‚ùå NEM HOZZ√ÅF√âRHET≈ê | ‚û°Ô∏è `private`           | ‚û°Ô∏è `private`       |
| `protected` inheritance    | ‚ùå NEM HOZZ√ÅF√âRHET≈ê | ‚û°Ô∏è `protected`         | ‚û°Ô∏è `protected`     |
| `public` inheritance       | ‚ùå NEM HOZZ√ÅF√âRHET≈ê | ‚û°Ô∏è `protected`         | ‚úÖ `public`        |

---

### üîç Notes:
- The left column is **inheritance type used in the derived class**.
- The top row is the **original access modifier in the base class**.
- This matches the layout from **Slide 27**, keeping all inaccessible cases in one column.


Here‚Äôs the original C++ code exactly as shown on the slide:

```cpp
class c1 {
private: 
    void A() {}
    void B() {}
public:
    void C() { A(); } // 1
protected: 
    void D() {}
};

class c2 : protected c1 {
public: 
    void D() {}
protected:
    void A() {
        B(); // 2
        C(); // 3
        D(); // 4
    }
private: 
    void E() {}
};

class c3 : public c2 {
public: 
    void F() {
        A(); // 5
        E(); // 6
    }
};

int main() {
    c1 t1; 
    c2 t2; 
    c3 t3;
    t1.C(); // 7
    t2.C(); // 8
    t3.D(); // 9
    t3.E(); // 10
    return 0;
}
```

Here is the original code with detailed **inline comments** explaining access levels, inheritance, and expected behavior at each step:

```cpp
class c1 {
private: 
    void A() {}              // Private: only accessible inside c1
    void B() {}              // Private: only accessible inside c1
public:
    void C() { A(); }        // Public: accessible anywhere, calls private A() internally // 1
protected: 
    void D() {}              // Protected: accessible in c1 and its subclasses
};

class c2 : protected c1 {     // Protected inheritance: public and protected members of c1 become protected in c2
public: 
    void D() {}               // Overrides D() from c1 with a public one (this hides the original D)
protected:
    void A() {                // This is a new method, not the same as c1::A (private in c1, so not inherited)
        B(); // 2             // Error: B is private in c1, so not accessible in c2
        C(); // 3             // OK: C() became protected in c2, callable here
        D(); // 4             // Calls the overridden D() from c2 (public), accessible here
    }
private: 
    void E() {}              // Private: only accessible inside c2
};

class c3 : public c2 {        // Public inheritance: c2's public/protected members keep their levels in c3
public: 
    void F() {
        A(); // 5            // Error: A() is protected in c2, accessible here in a method of c3
        E(); // 6            // Error: E() is private in c2, so not accessible in c3
    }
};

int main() {
    c1 t1; 
    c2 t2; 
    c3 t3;

    t1.C(); // 7             // OK: C is public in c1
    t2.C(); // 8             // Error: C is protected in c2 (due to protected inheritance from c1)
    t3.D(); // 9             // OK: D is public in c2 and inherited as public in c3
    t3.E(); // 10            // Error: E is private in c2, so not accessible from outside
    return 0;
}
```

### Summary of issues:
- // 2, 5, 6, 8, and 10 cause **access errors** due to C++ access rules.
- // 1, 3, 4, 7, and 9 are **valid** usages.

Let me know if you'd like a cleaned-up, working version or a table summarizing what works and what doesn‚Äôt.


Thanks for sharing the code slide! Here's a **detailed breakdown** of each marked line and what works or fails, based on access specifiers and inheritance types.

---

### üîç **Line-by-line explanation:**

```cpp
void C() { A(); }  // (1)
```
- ‚úÖ **Works** because `C()` is a method inside `c1`, and it can access its own private method `A()`.

```cpp
B(); // (2)
```
- ‚úÖ **Works**: `B()` is private in `c1`, but accessible within the derived class `c2`'s **own method** `A()` because of `protected` inheritance.

```cpp
C(); // (3)
```
- ‚úÖ **Works**: `C()` is public in `c1`, and `protected` inheritance in `c2` makes it protected, so it‚Äôs accessible inside member functions of `c2`.

```cpp
D(); // (4)
```
- ‚úÖ **Works**: This calls `D()` from `c2` (which overrides the `protected` `D()` from `c1`), and it‚Äôs within the same class.

```cpp
A(); // (5)
```
- ‚ùå **Error**: `A()` is protected in `c2` (inherited privately from `c1`), but `F()` is in `c3`. Even though `c3` publicly inherits `c2`, `A()` is not accessible here.

```cpp
E(); // (6)
```
- ‚ùå **Error**: `E()` is `private` in `c2`, so it's **not accessible** in `c3`.

```cpp
t1.C(); // (7)
```
- ‚úÖ **Works**: `C()` is public in `c1`.

```cpp
t2.C(); // (8)
```
- ‚ùå **Error**: `C()` was inherited as **protected** in `c2`, so it is not accessible **outside** of class `c2`.

```cpp
t3.D(); // (9)
```
- ‚úÖ **Works**: `D()` is `public` in `c2`, and `c3` inherits it publicly.

```cpp
t3.E(); // (10)
```
- ‚ùå **Error**: `E()` is `private` in `c2`, so it's not accessible from outside, including `main`.

This slide summarizes **how constructors work in inheritance** in C++. Here's the key breakdown:

---

### üîπ Slide Title: *Sz√°rmaztatott oszt√°ly l√©trehoz√°sa*  
(*Creating a Derived Class*)

---

### üîß Key Points Explained:

#### 1. **A sz√°rmaztatott oszt√°lynak saj√°t konstruktorokra van sz√ºks√©ge**  
(*The derived class needs its own constructors*)

- This is required **to initialize new data members** added in the derived class.
- Also handles **allocation for dynamic members** if any (e.g., using `new`).

#### 2. **Az ≈ës konstruktora automatikusan megh√≠v√≥dik**  
(*The base class constructor is called automatically*)

- Even if we don't call it explicitly, the constructor of the base class is always invoked **before** the derived class constructor runs.
- **Debugger behavior**: First the derived constructor is reached (entry point), but then the program jumps to the base class constructor (step into), and only after that returns to the derived one.

#### 3. **Chained Inheritance**
- If the base class has its own base class, its constructor is also invoked automatically‚Äî**in order of inheritance** (top-down).

---

Let me know if you want a concrete code example to illustrate this constructor flow!

This slide explains **explicit constructor calls** for base classes in C++ and other languages. Here's a breakdown:

---

### üîπ Title: *Sz√°rmaztatott oszt√°ly l√©trehoz√°sa*  
(*Creating a Derived Class*)

---

### üîß Main Idea:
You can **explicitly call the constructor of a base class** from a derived class.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Concepts:

#### üî∏ Syntax is similar to member initialization:
- Instead of initializing a member variable, you specify the base class name.
- Example in **C++**:
  ```cpp
  class Child : public Parent {
  public:
      Child() : Parent(42) { // Explicit call to Parent's constructor with argument 42
      }
  };
  ```

#### üî∏ When is it needed?
- When you **want to control** *which* constructor of the base class is called (e.g., passing parameters).

---

### üåê Language Comparison:

| Language | Base Constructor Call |
|----------|------------------------|
| **C++**  | Use base class name directly: `Parent()` |
| **C#**   | Use `base`: `base(42)` |
| **Java** | Use `super`: `super(42)` |
| **Python** | Also `super()`: `super().__init__(...)` |

---

Let me know if you want example code in multiple languages!

Sure! Here's an example of **explicit base constructor call in C++** using inheritance:

---

### üîπ Example: C++ ‚Äì Explicit Base Constructor Call

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class (Parent)
class Animal {
public:
    Animal(string name) {
        cout << "Animal constructor called with name: " << name << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class (Child)
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    Dog() : Animal("Doggo") { // üëà Explicit base constructor call
        cout << "Dog constructor called" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Dog d;
    return 0;
}
```

---

### üîç Output:
```
Animal constructor called with name: Doggo
Dog constructor called
```

---

### ‚úÖ Explanation:
- `Animal(string name)` is the base class constructor.
- `Dog()` is the derived class constructor, and it explicitly calls `Animal("Doggo")` using a member initializer list.
- This is essential when the base class constructor requires arguments and has no default constructor.

Let me know if you want the same example in Python, Java, or C#!


Sure! Here's the **original code** from the slide, exactly as shown, without any added comments:

```cpp
class Emlos {
private:
    string nev;

public:
    Emlos(const string &pnev):nev(pnev){}
    void beallitNev(const string &pnev){
        nev=pnev;
    }
    const string& lekerNev() const {
        return nev;
    }
};

class Kutya:public Emlos {
private:
    bool setal_e;

public:
    Kutya(const string &pnev):Emlos(pnev), setal_e(false){
    }
    void beallitSetal_e(bool psetel_e){
        setal_e=psetel_e;
    }
    void setal();
    ~Kutya(){
        cout<<lekerNev()<<" kutyus elhal√°lozott. ";
    }
};
```

Here is the original code from the slide with **inline comments** added to help explain what's going on:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Base class: Emlos (Mammal)
class Emlos {
private:
    string nev;  // name of the animal

public:
    // Constructor that initializes the name
    Emlos(const string &pnev) : nev(pnev) {}

    // Setter method to change the name
    void beallitNev(const string &pnev) {
        nev = pnev;
    }

    // Getter method to return the name
    const string& lekerNev() const {
        return nev;
    }
};

// Derived class: Kutya (Dog), publicly inherits from Emlos
class Kutya : public Emlos {
private:
    bool setal_e;  // indicates whether the dog is walking

public:
    // Constructor that calls base constructor and initializes setal_e
    Kutya(const string &pnev) : Emlos(pnev), setal_e(false) {}

    // Setter for setal_e
    void beallitSetal_e(bool psetel_e) {
        setal_e = psetel_e;
    }

    // Presumably this would implement walking logic
    void setal();

    // Destructor outputs the dog's name and a message
    ~Kutya() {
        cout << lekerNev() << " kutyus elhal√°lozott. ";  // calls base method
    }
};
```

Let me know if you'd like the `setal()` function implemented or if you'd like this in another language for comparison!

Here's the **original code** from the slide titled *"P√©lda folytat√°sa (C++)"*, without comments:

```cpp
class Emlos {
private:
    string nev;

public:
    Emlos(const string &pnev):nev(pnev){}
    void beallitNev(const string &pnev){
        nev=pnev;
    }
    const string& lekerNev() const {
        return nev;
    }
};

class Ember:public Emlos {
public:
    Ember(const string& pnev):Emlos(pnev){
    }
    void setaltat(Kutya& kutya){
        cout << lekerNev() << " s√©t√°ltatja "
             << kutya.lekerNev() << "-t. ";
        kutya.setal();
    }
    ~Ember(){}
};
```

Sure! Here's the same **C++ code with inline comments** explaining key parts:

```cpp
class Emlos {
private:
    string nev;  // Private member to store the name

public:
    Emlos(const string &pnev):nev(pnev){}  // Constructor initializing 'nev'

    void beallitNev(const string &pnev){  // Setter for 'nev'
        nev = pnev;
    }

    const string& lekerNev() const {  // Getter for 'nev'
        return nev;
    }
};

class Ember : public Emlos {  // Ember inherits publicly from Emlos
public:
    Ember(const string& pnev): Emlos(pnev) {  // Call base class constructor explicitly
    }

    void setaltat(Kutya& kutya){  // Member function to walk a dog
        cout << lekerNev() << " s√©t√°ltatja "  // Uses Emlos::lekerNev()
             << kutya.lekerNev() << "-t. ";  // Uses Emlos::lekerNev() from Kutya
        kutya.setal();  // Calls the dog's walking method
    }

    ~Ember(){}  // Destructor
};
```

Let me know if you'd like me to include the `Kutya` class as well for completeness!

Of course! Here's the **complete example** including the `Kutya` class and inline comments throughout:

```cpp
class Emlos {
private:
    string nev;  // Private member to store name

public:
    Emlos(const string &pnev) : nev(pnev) {}  // Constructor initializing 'nev'

    void beallitNev(const string &pnev) {  // Setter for 'nev'
        nev = pnev;
    }

        // Call base class constructor
    }

    void setaltat(Kutya& kutya) {
        // Human walks the dog
        cout << lekerNev() << " s√©t√°ltatja "   // Human name
             << kutya.lekerNev() << "-t. ";    // Dog name
        kutya.setal();  // Dog walks
    }

    ~Ember() {}  // Destructor
};
```

Let me know if you want a `main()` function to show this in action, or diagram-style notes like from the slides!

The image you shared is a **UML (Unified Modeling Language) class diagram** showing inheritance relationships between classes in a simplified "dog-walking" program. Here's a summary of what the diagram depicts:

---

### üì¶ UML Class Diagram (from Umbrello)

#### Base Class
**`kutya_setal_java.Emlos`**
- **Attributes:**
  - `- nev : String` ‚Üí private name attribute.
- **Methods:**
  - `+ Emlos(pnev : String)` ‚Üí constructor.
  - `+ beallitNev(pnev : String)` ‚Üí setter.
  - `+ lekerNev() : String` ‚Üí getter.

#### Derived Class 1
**`kutya_setal_java.Kutya`** (inherits from `Emlos`)
- **Attributes:**
  - `- setal_e : boolean` ‚Üí private walking status.
- **Methods:**
  - `+ Kutya(pnev : String)` ‚Üí constructor (calls base).
  - `+ beallitSetal_e(psetal_e : boolean)` ‚Üí setter for walking status.
  - `+ setal()` ‚Üí performs walking.

#### Derived Class 2
**`kutya_setal_java.Ember`** (also inherits from `Emlos`)
- **Methods:**
  - `+ Ember(pnev : String)` ‚Üí constructor (calls base).
  - `~ setaltat(kutya : Kutya)` ‚Üí walks the dog. `~` might suggest package-private or protected.

Would you like a code version of this Java-style UML diagram or a conversion to another language (like Python)?

The slide explains how **destructors** behave in **C++ class inheritance**, focusing on the order of destruction and the necessity of explicitly defining destructors in derived classes. Here's a summary:

---

### üìå Destruction of Derived Classes in C++

#### üîß Why a derived class needs its own destructor:
- To **free memory** allocated for new dynamic members specific to the derived class.

#### üîÑ Destructor execution order:
- When a derived class object is destroyed:
  1. The **derived class destructor** is executed.
  2. Then, the **base class destructor** is **automatically called**.
  3. If the base class has its own base (multi-level inheritance), its destructor is also called.

#### üß≠ Debugging tip:
- If the derived class **has no destructor**, the base class destructor still runs, but **step-by-step debugging** might skip it.
- Use **breakpoints** in the base class destructor to verify it executes.

---

Let me know if you want a C++ code example showing this destructor chaining in action!


**Conversion to Base Class:**
- A derived class contains its base class, and we can reference it using a pointer or reference of the base class type.
- Typically, the conversion between a pointer to the base class and a pointer to the derived class is implicit, but to avoid ambiguity, we should use explicit conversion.
- We can convert a class to its base class type without writing a conversion operator.
  - A temporary object is created, and it cannot be assigned as a left-hand value.


### Converting objects to their base class

The slide appears to be discussing the concept of converting objects to their base class type in object-oriented programming, specifically within the context of C++ or similar languages.

The key points mentioned are:

1. **Using base class pointers** allows for storing different types of objects in a single array (or container). 
2. These objects need to be part of an **inheritance tree** (i.e., they must be derived from a common base class).
3. To access the full features of a derived class through a base class pointer, **explicit conversion** (casting) is required to the appropriate derived class type.

Would you like to go over any specific part of this explanation in more detail?

### Redeclaring members


1. In a **derived class**, you can redeclare a member (variable or function) with the same name as one already present in the **base class**.
2. The **old member** still exists and is accessible, but the new member **hides** the old one.
3. The old member can still be accessed using the **scope operator**.
4. Simple references to the member will refer to the **new member** in the derived class.

Would you like to explore this concept further or need help with an example?


### Virtu√°lis f√ºggv√©nyek

This slide discusses **virtual functions** in object-oriented programming, focusing on the concept of **early binding** (static binding) and **late binding** (dynamic binding):

1. **Non-virtual function calls**: 
   - The type of the variable through which the function is called matters.
   - This decision is made at **compile-time**, which is why it is referred to as **early binding**.
   - When accessing a function through a base class pointer, we cannot know ahead of time what type the pointer will refer to at runtime.

2. **Virtual function calls**:
   - The actual **runtime type** of the variable matters.
   - The function call is resolved at **runtime**, which is known as **late binding**.

This explains how polymorphism works with virtual functions, ensuring that the correct function is called based on the actual object type during execution.

Would you like further clarification on this topic?

### Inherited members

This slide discusses **inherited members** in object-oriented programming:

1. A **derived class** implicitly contains all the members of its **base class**.
2. When calling an **inherited method**, the location where the method is defined plays a role in determining the method‚Äôs context.
   - This is particularly important for **virtual functions**.
   - If you redefine the method in the **derived class** in the same way it was defined in the **base class**, it does not behave the same as an inherited method because the **context during the call** is different.

This highlights the importance of understanding how method overriding works, especially when dealing with virtual functions and inheritance. 

Would you like further examples or a deeper dive into this concept?


### Virtual functions in C++


This slide discusses **virtual functions in C++**. Here's the summary and translation of the points:

1. **Definition**: A **virtual function** is a function that is redefined in a derived class. We want to ensure that the **appropriate function variant** is called, based on the actual object type.
   
2. **Syntax**: The function is declared with the `virtual` keyword.
   - The `virtual` keyword is **only required in the declaration** and is optional in definitions.
   
3. If a function is **virtual**, then it is considered virtual in the derived class as well, even **without the `virtual` keyword**.
   - **Constructors** cannot be virtual.

4. The functionality of a virtual function can be **overridden** using the **scope operator**.

This concept ensures **polymorphism** in C++, where the correct function is called based on the actual object type rather than the type of the pointer or reference.

Would you like further examples or explanations of how this works in practice?

### P√©lda (C++)

Here is the C++ code as requested:

```cpp
class Emlos {
private:
    string nev;
public:
    Emlos(const string &pnev) : nev(pnev) {}
    void beallitNev(const string &pnev) {
        nev = pnev;
    }
    virtual string lekerNev() const {
        return nev;
    }
    virtual ~Emlos() {}
};

class Ember : public Emlos {
private:
    string vezetekNev;
public:
    Ember(const string &pvnev, const string &pnev) : Emlos(pnev), vezetekNev(pvnev) {}
    string lekerNev() const {
        return vezetekNev + ' ' + Emlos::lekerNev();
    }
    void setaltat(Kutya &kutya) {
        cout << lekerNev() << " s√©t√°ltatja " << kutya.lekerNev() << "-t. ";
        kutya.setal();
    }
    virtual ~Ember() {}
};
``` 

Let me know if you need further explanation or adjustments to the code!

Here is the C++ code with inline comments added:

```cpp
class Emlos {
private:
    string nev; // Member variable to store the name
public:
    // Constructor to initialize the name
    Emlos(const string &pnev) : nev(pnev) {}

    // Method to set the name
    void beallitNev(const string &pnev) {
        nev = pnev;
    }

    // Virtual method to return the name, allows overriding in derived classes
    virtual string lekerNev() const {
        return nev;
    }

    // Virtual destructor for proper cleanup when using polymorphism
    virtual ~Emlos() {}
};

class Ember : public Emlos {
private:
    string vezetekNev; // Member variable to store the surname
public:
    // Constructor to initialize the first name and surname
    Ember(const string &pvnev, const string &pnev) : Emlos(pnev), vezetekNev(pvnev) {}

    // Override lekerNev to return full name (surname + first name)
    string lekerNev() const {
        return vezetekNev + ' ' + Emlos::lekerNev(); // Concatenate surname and first name
    }

    // Method to simulate walking a dog
    void setaltat(Kutya &kutya) {
        // Print who is walking the dog and call the dog's walking method
        cout << lekerNev() << " s√©t√°ltatja " << kutya.lekerNev() << "-t. ";
        kutya.setal();
    }

    // Virtual destructor for proper cleanup of Ember objects
    virtual ~Ember() {}
};
```

The comments explain the purpose of each part of the code. Let me know if you need further clarification!

### P√©lda folytat√°sa (C++)

Here is the C++ code with comments explaining the functionality:

```cpp
int main() {
    Kutya bloki("Bl√∂ki");  // Creating a "Kutya" object named "Bl√∂ki"
    Ember rozi("Kov√°cs", "Rozi");  // Creating an "Ember" object with first name "Rozi" and surname "Kov√°cs"
    
    // Calling the "setaltat" method, which prints who is walking the dog
    rozi.setaltat(bloki);  // Output: Kov√°cs Rozi s√©t√°ltatja Bl√∂ki-t. Bl√∂ki s√©t√°l

    // Creating a pointer to the base class "Emlos" and assigning it the address of "bloki"
    Emlos *emlosp = &bloki;
    cout << emlosp->lekerNev() << endl;  // Output: Bl√∂ki (calling the base class method)

    // Reassigning the pointer to the address of "rozi"
    emlosp = &rozi;
    cout << emlosp->lekerNev() << endl;  // Output: Kov√°cs Rozi (calling the overridden method in the derived class)

    return 0;  // End of program (Bl√∂ki kutyus elhal√°lozott - Bl√∂ki the dog passed away)
}
```

The code demonstrates:

- Creating objects of `Kutya` and `Ember`.
- Calling a method (`setaltat`) which uses polymorphism.
- Using a base class pointer (`Emlos`) to call methods on objects of derived classes (`Kutya`, `Ember`).

This approach demonstrates how **polymorphism** works in C++, where the appropriate method is called depending on the actual object type, even when accessed through a base class pointer.

Let me know if you'd like more explanations or adjustments!


Here is the **UML diagram** for the C++ example that shows the relationships between the `Emlos`, `Ember`, and `Kutya` classes.

### UML Diagram Explanation:

- **Emlos Class**:
  - Attributes:
    - `nev`: string (the name)
  - Methods:
    - `Emlos(pnev: const string&)`: Constructor
    - `beallitNev(pnev: const string&)`: Method to set name
    - `lekerNev()`: Virtual method to get name
    - `~Emlos()`: Destructor

- **Ember Class** (inherits from `Emlos`):
  - Attributes:
    - `vezetekNev`: string (surname)
  - Methods:
    - `Ember(pvnev: const string&, pnev: const string&)`: Constructor
    - `lekerNev()`: Override method to get full name
    - `setaltat(kutya: Kutya&)`: Method to walk the dog
    - `~Ember()`: Destructor

- **Kutya Class**:
  - Attributes:
    - `setal_e`: bool (walking status)
  - Methods:
    - `Kutya(pselet_e: bool)`: Constructor
    - `beallitSetal_e(pselet_e: bool)`: Method to set walking status
    - `setal()`: Method to perform walking action
    - `~Kutya()`: Destructor

This structure shows **inheritance** between `Emlos` and `Ember` and a **composition** (association) between `Ember` and `Kutya`.

If you'd like, I can generate this diagram visually or help you with any other UML-related queries.

### Virtu√°lis f√ºggv√©nyek

This slide discusses the **ambiguity** that can arise when calling overridden functions in C++ with **virtual functions**:

1. **Calling a base class function** through a **base class pointer** that points to a derived object.
   - This scenario can lead to ambiguity, particularly when the function is overridden in the derived class (as seen in the previous example).
   
2. **Calling an inherited function** that in turn calls another function which has been **overridden** in the derived class.
   - This creates a situation where:
     - If the function is **virtual**: The actual object type (derived type) matters, so the function from the derived class is called.
     - If the function is **non-virtual**: The base class version of the function is called, even if the object is of the derived type.

This concept highlights the importance of using **virtual functions** to ensure that the correct function from the derived class is called based on the actual object type.

Would you like more examples or clarification on how this affects program behavior?

### P√©lda (C++)


Here is the C++ code you provided:

```cpp
class c1 {
public:
    void A() { cout << "2"; }
    void B() { cout << "3"; A(); C(); }
    virtual void C() { cout << "4"; }
};

class c2 : public c1 {
public:
    void A() { cout << "1"; }
};

class c3 : public c2 {
public:
    void A() { cout << "6"; }
    void C() { cout << "5"; }
    // C virtual!!
};

int main(){
    c1 t1; 
    c3 t3, *p3 = &t3; 
    c2 *p2 = &t3;
    
    t1.A(); 
    cout << endl; // 2
    
    t1.B(); 
    cout << endl; // 324
    
    t3.A(); 
    cout << endl; // 6
    
    t3.C(); 
    cout << endl; // 5
    
    p2->A(); 
    cout << endl; // 1
    
    p3->C(); 
    cout << endl; // 5
    
    t3.B(); 
    cout << endl; // 325
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates **method overriding** with virtual functions in C++. Here's the breakdown of the output:

1. **t1.A()** calls the `A` function of class `c1` and prints "2".
2. **t1.B()** calls `B` from class `c1`, which calls `A` (prints "2") and `C` (prints "4"), leading to the output "324".
3. **t3.A()** calls `A` from class `c3` and prints "6".
4. **t3.C()** calls `C` from class `c3` (overridden) and prints "5".
5. **p2->A()** calls `A` from class `c2` and prints "1".
6. **p3->C()** calls the **virtual function** `C` from class `c3` and prints "5".
7. **t3.B()** calls `B` from class `c1`, which calls `A` (prints "6") and `C` (prints "5"), leading to "325".

Let me know if you need further clarification or any modifications!

Here is the code with **inline comments** added for better understanding:

```cpp
class c1 {
public:
    // Function A prints "2"
    void A() { cout << "2"; }

    // Function B prints "3", then calls A() and C() functions
    void B() { 
        cout << "3";  // Print "3"
        A();          // Calls A() from c1, prints "2"
        C();          // Calls C(), which prints "4" (virtual, may change in derived classes)
    }

    // Virtual function C, prints "4" (can be overridden in derived classes)
    virtual void C() { cout << "4"; }
};

class c2 : public c1 {
public:
    // Override function A, prints "1" instead of "2"
    void A() { cout << "1"; }
};

class c3 : public c2 {
public:
    // Override function A, prints "6" instead of "1"
    void A() { cout << "6"; }

    // Override function C, prints "5" instead of "4"
    void C() { cout << "5"; }
    // Note: C is virtual, so the derived class version will be used
};

int main() {
    c1 t1;            // Create an object of class c1
    c3 t3, *p3 = &t3; // Create an object of class c3 and pointer p3 to it
    c2 *p2 = &t3;     // Create a pointer p2 to base class c2, pointing to an object of c3
    
    t1.A();           // Call A() on c1 object, prints "2"
    cout << endl;
    
    t1.B();           // Call B() on c1 object, prints "324"
    cout << endl;
    
    t3.A();           // Call A() on c3 object, prints "6"
    cout << endl;
    
    t3.C();           // Call C() on c3 object, prints "5" (overridden C)
    cout << endl;
    
    p2->A();          // Call A() on c2 object via pointer, prints "1"
    cout << endl;
    
    p3->C();          // Call C() on c3 object via pointer, prints "5" (overridden C)
    cout << endl;
    
    t3.B();           // Call B() on c3 object, prints "325"
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Virtual Function**: The function `C()` is marked as `virtual` in class `c1`, allowing it to be overridden in derived classes like `c3`. This ensures the correct version of `C()` is called at runtime, depending on the actual object type.
- **Method Overriding**: The `A()` and `C()` methods are overridden in `c2` and `c3`, changing the behavior of the class methods.
- **Function Calls**: The program demonstrates polymorphism, where calling functions via base class pointers (`p2`, `p3`) resolves to the correct overridden method.

Let me know if you need further clarification!



In the provided UML diagram, the **arrows** connecting the functions indicate the relationships between the base and derived class methods, as well as the **flow of method calls** through inheritance and **virtual method dispatch**. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what each arrow likely represents:

1. **Arrows pointing from one class method to another**:
   - These arrows show **overridden methods** in derived classes. For example:
     - The arrow from `c1::A()` to `c2::A()` means that `A()` in class `c2` is **overriding** the base class's `A()` method.
     - The arrow from `c2::A()` to `c3::A()` means that `A()` in `c3` is overriding the `A()` method in `c2`.
   
2. **Arrows with labels like `v` (virtual)**:
   - These arrows indicate **virtual function calls**. The virtual function mechanism allows the **derived class method** to be called, even when the call is made using a pointer or reference to the base class. For example:
     - The arrow with `v` between `c1::C()` and `c2::C()` means that `C()` in `c1` is virtual, and the function is **resolved at runtime** based on the actual object type, not the pointer type.

3. **Arrows pointing to `VMT`** (Virtual Method Table):
   - These arrows show how **virtual methods** are looked up in the **virtual method table (VMT)**. The VMT is a mechanism used in C++ to support **runtime polymorphism**. When a virtual function is called on an object, the actual function called depends on the object‚Äôs runtime type (not the type of the pointer), which is determined via the VMT.
   
4. **Arrows pointing to specific methods** like `C()`:
   - These arrows represent the **actual call to the method**. The arrow from `c1::C()` to `VMT` suggests that the virtual dispatch for `C()` is handled through the VMT, so it ensures the correct version of `C()` is called at runtime.

### Summary:
- The **arrows connecting functions** show the method **overrides** in derived classes and demonstrate how **virtual dispatch** works with the VMT to call the appropriate method at runtime.

If you'd like a more detailed explanation or clarification about any part of the diagram, feel free to ask!

### H√≠vott met√≥dus azonos√≠t√°sa

This slide explains **method resolution** when calling a method from a base class (`x`) on an object of a derived class (`y`) in object-oriented programming. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

1. **Calling a method from a derived class (`y`)** using an object that is actually of the base class type (`x`):
   - **Passing `y` as an argument of type `x`**:
     - The method of `z` (method in the derived class) is called using the parameter `z`, even though `x` is the declared type.
   - **Using a pointer or reference of type `x`** to refer to an object of type `y`:
     - The method of `z` is called on the object of type `y`, despite the reference or pointer being of type `x`.

2. **When calling a virtual method (`z`)**:
   - **If the method is virtual** (even if declared in the base class):
     - The method from the **derived class (`y`)** is called, ensuring polymorphism.
   - **If the method is not virtual**:
     - The method from the **base class (`x`)** is called, as there is no late binding.

### Key points:
- **Polymorphism** in action: Virtual functions ensure that the correct version of a function (from the derived class) is called, even when the function is called using a base class pointer/reference.
  
Would you like further examples or details on how this works in code?

### H√≠vott met√≥dus azonos√≠t√°sa

This slide provides **examples of method resolution** in C++:

1. **p2->A() call**:
   - **x = c2, y = c3, z = A()** (non-virtual):
     - Here, `A()` is **non-virtual**. So, when calling `A()` on the `c3` object through a pointer of type `c2`, the **method of `c2`** will be called (not the overridden method in `c3`).
     - **Output**: `c2::A()` will be called.

2. **t3.B() call, and inside B(), calling C()**:
   - **x = c1, y = c3, z = C()** (virtual):
     - Here, `C()` is **virtual**, so the **method of `c3`** will be called at runtime, based on the actual object type (`c3`), not the pointer type (`c1`).
     - **Output**: `c3::C()` will be called.

### Key Concepts:
- **Non-virtual methods**: The method from the **declared type** (e.g., `c2`) is called, regardless of the actual object type (e.g., `c3`).
- **Virtual methods**: The method from the **actual object type** (e.g., `c3`) is called, even when accessed through a base class pointer (`c1`).

This illustrates how **polymorphism** works in C++, with virtual methods ensuring that the correct method for the actual object type is called at runtime.
