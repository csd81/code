# Operator overloading

**TL;DR – Operator overloading & fast set operations in C++**

* **Operator overloading** lets you define how operators (`+`, `==`, etc.) work with your custom classes.
* You **can’t** change operator precedence, arity, or create new operators.
* Use **member functions** if the left operand is your class and the operation changes it (like `+=`), otherwise use **non-member functions**.
* `++` and `--` have **prefix/postfix** versions, postfix uses a dummy `int` parameter.
* You can allow **implicit type conversion** via constructors or define **conversion operators** (e.g., `operator int()`).
* **Fast set operations**:

  * `std::set`: slow (tree-based)
  * `std::unordered_set`: faster (hash-based)
  * `boost::dynamic_bitset`, `smallset`, `objset`: very fast using bitwise ops
* **Bit-based sets** are best for large domains with sparse elements and frequent operations.

**TL;DR in English: Operator Overloading in C++**

* **Motivation:**
  Makes code **shorter and more readable**.

* **Where it's applicable:**

  * Operators are defined for **built-in types** by default.
  * You can also define them for **your own types** or **mixed use** (custom + built-in).

* **Limitations:**

  * You can only **overload existing operators** — no new ones.
  * You **cannot change the number of operands** (e.g., binary `+` must stay binary).
  * You **cannot change operator precedence** (e.g., `*` will always bind tighter than `+`).









**Modifiable vs Non-modifiable Operators in C++**

### ✅ **Modifiable (Overloadable) Operators:**

**Arithmetic:**
`+  -  *  /  %  ^`

**Bitwise & Logical:**
`&  |  ~  !  =  <  >`

**Compound Assignment:**
`+=  -=  *=  /=  %=  ^=  &=  |=  <<=  >>=`

**Comparison:**
`==  !=  <=  >=`

**Logical:**
`&&  ||`

**Increment/Decrement:**
`++  --`

**Pointer & Member Access:**
`->*  ,  ->`

**Subscript / Function Call / Memory:**
`[]  ()  new  new[]  delete  delete[]`

---

### ❌ **Non-modifiable (Not Overloadable) Operators:**

`::  .  .*  ? :  sizeof  typeid`

> These operators are part of the core language syntax or type information and **cannot** be redefined.



In C++, operator overloading is implemented by defining special functions that specify the behavior of operators for user-defined types. These functions use the `operator` keyword followed by the operator symbol. The syntax is similar to regular function definitions.([programiz.com][1])

### 🔧 Syntax

```cpp
return_type operatorOP(arguments) {
    // implementation
}
```



* **`return_type`**: The type of value the operator function returns.
* **`operator`**: A keyword indicating that this is an operator function.
* **`OP`**: The operator symbol being overloaded (e.g., `+`, `-`, `==`).
* **`arguments`**: The parameters the operator function takes.([doulos.com][2])

Depending on the operator and the desired behavior, the function can be defined as a member function or a non-member (often friend) function.

### 📌 Argument and Return Types

* **Arguments**: For large objects, it's efficient to pass arguments by reference to avoid unnecessary copying.
* **Return Types**:

  * For operators that create new objects (e.g., `+`), return by value:

    ```cpp
    Complex operator+(const Complex& lhs, const Complex& rhs) {
        // implementation
    }
    ```

  * For operators that modify the object (e.g., `+=`), return by reference to allow chaining:

    ```cpp
    Complex& operator+=(const Complex& rhs) {
        // implementation
        return *this;
    }
    ```

This approach ensures efficient and expected behavior when using overloaded operators.

### 📘 Example

Here's how you might overload the `+` operator for a `Complex` class:([programiz.com][1])

```cpp
class Complex {
private:
    double real, imag;
public:
    Complex(double r = 0, double i = 0) : real(r), imag(i) {}

    // Overload + operator
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) const {
        return Complex(real + other.real, imag + other.imag);
    }
};
```



This allows you to add two `Complex` objects using the `+` operator.

**TL;DR: Member vs. Non-Member Operator Overloading in C++**

* **Member Function Overloading**:

  * Used when the operator modifies the object (e.g., `+=`, `++`).
  * The left-hand operand must be an instance of the class.
  * Access to private and protected members is direct.([slideplayer.com][1])

* **Non-Member Function Overloading**:

  * Useful for symmetric operations where the left-hand operand isn't a class instance (e.g., `int + MyClass`).
  * Can be declared as `friend` to access private members.
  * Enhances encapsulation by limiting access to class internals.

**Example**:

```cpp
class Int {
public:
    Int& operator++(); // Member function: ++i
    friend Int operator++(Int& i, int); // Non-member function: i++
};
```



In this example, `operator++()` is a member function handling prefix increment, while `operator++(Int& i, int)` is a non-member function handling postfix increment.

Choosing between member and non-member functions depends on the specific requirements of the operator's behavior and operand types.
 

 Here is the English translation of **slide 9** from the PDF:

---

### Member Function or Non-member Function

* As a **non-member function**:

```cpp
Int& operator++(Int &i) {
    ...
    return i;
}
```

* If the **first argument belongs to the class**, the operator can also be defined as a **member function**:

```cpp
Int& Int::operator++(void) {
    ...
    return *this;
}
```

Here is the English translation of **slide 10**:

---

### Special Case

* The `++` and `--` operators are, by default, **prefix**.
* The **postfix** version can be distinguished by adding a **dummy argument** of type `int`.

```cpp
class Int {
    ...
public:
    ...
    Int& operator++(void);  // Prefix
    Int& operator++(int);   // Postfix
};
```

---

Would you like me to explain the difference between prefix and postfix increment in detail?


Here is the English translation of **slide 11**:

---

### Member Function and Non-member Function with Two Arguments

* As a **non-member function**:

```cpp
Int operator+(const Int &a, const Int &b) {
    Int s = a;
    return s += b;
}
```

* As a **member function**:

```cpp
const Int& Int::operator+=(const Int& b) {
    ival += b.ival;
    return *this;
}
```

---

Would you like to see how this works in practice with a full example?



Here is the English translation of **slide 12**:

---

### Parameter Type Modifiers

(**continued**)

* If the operator is **destructive** (i.e., it modifies its operand), the **first parameter** is a **reference**, and the return value is typically a **const reference** to the modified object:

```cpp
const Int& operator+=(Int &a, const Int &b) {
    a.ival += b.ival;
    return a;
}
```

* As a **member function**:

```cpp
const Int& Int::operator+=(const Int& b) {
    ival += b.ival;
    return *this;
}
```

---

Would you like the next slide as well?

Here is the English translation of **slide 13**:

---

### Parameter Type Modifiers

* If the operator is **non-destructive** (i.e., it does **not** modify its operands), the **return value** is a **copy** of the object, and the **parameters** are passed as **constant references** (especially for large objects):

```cpp
Int operator+(const Int &a, const Int &b) {
    Int s = a;
    return s += b;
}
```

* As a **member function**:

```cpp
Int Int::operator+(const Int& b) const {
    Int s = *this;
    return s += b;
}
```

Here is the English translation of **slide 14**:

---

### Member Function or Non-member Function

* It is preferable to have as **few functions as possible access the private data** of an object—i.e., to define **as few member functions** as necessary when overloading operators.

* We can achieve this by implementing **only those operators as member functions** that **modify their first parameter** (e.g., `++`, `=`, `+=`).

* Operators that **just produce a new value** can be implemented as **non-member functions**, even if they use member functions internally.

---

Would you like to move on to slide 15?




This slide contrasts two different ways to implement operator overloading in C++ for a class `Int` using two parameters: as a **non-member function** and as a **member function**.

---

### 🔹 Non-member Function Version

```cpp
Int operator+(const Int &a, const Int &b) {
    Int s = a;
    return s += b;
}
```

**Explanation:**

* `operator+` is defined **outside the class**.
* It takes two `const Int&` parameters: `a` and `b`. Since it doesn't modify them, they are passed as **const references**.
* It creates a **copy of `a`** (`Int s = a;`) so the original `a` remains unchanged.
* Then it uses `operator+=` to add `b` to the copy `s`.
* Finally, it returns the modified `s` by **value**, because the result is a new object.

🟢 Use case: This is suitable for **non-destructive operations** like `+`, which return a new result without modifying the inputs.

---

### 🔹 Member Function Version

```cpp
const Int& Int::operator+=(const Int& b) {
    ival += b.ival;
    return *this;
}
```

**Explanation:**

* This is a **member function** of the `Int` class.
* It modifies the current object (`*this`) by adding the `ival` (presumably an internal integer) of another `Int` object `b`.
* It returns `*this` as a **const reference**, which allows chaining like `a += b += c;`.

🟠 Use case: This is suitable for **destructive operations** like `+=`, which modify the object.

---

### Summary:

| Aspect            | `operator+` (non-member)            | `operator+=` (member)               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Modifies `*this`? | ❌ No                               | ✅ Yes                              |
| Returns           | New object (by value)               | Reference to self (const `*this`)   |
| Usage pattern     | `c = a + b;`                        | `a += b;`                           |
| Why non-member?   | Doesn't need to access private data | Relies on member function like `+=` |
| Why member?       | Needs access to private `ival`      | Efficient for in-place modification |

Here is the English translation of **slide 16**:

---

### Initialization Assignment

* **Initialization assignment** does **not** call the `=` operator, but rather a **constructor**.

```cpp
Int x = 10;         // Calls the constructor: Int(10)
// Same as:
Int x(10);
```

* This is **not** the same as:

```cpp
Int x;              // Calls the default constructor: Int()
x = 10;             // Calls the assignment operator: operator=
```

* When using **multiple parameters**, the class name **must be explicitly written**:

```cpp
complex x = complex(2, 2);
// The copy constructor (const complex&) is also invoked
```

---

Would you like me to go over how constructors and assignment operators differ in behavior and purpose?


Here is the English translation of **slide 17**:

---

### Type Conversion via Constructor

* If an **operator or method** can be called on an object of class **A**, and **A** has a constructor that takes a parameter of type **B**, then it can also be called with a **B** type — because the compiler will automatically create an object of class **A** from the **B** type.

Example:

```cpp
Int x = 10;
Int z;
z = x + 1;
// The Int class does not have an operator+ for int,
// but it does have a constructor that takes an int
```

In this case, the compiler **implicitly converts `1` into an `Int` object** using the constructor, then applies the `operator+`.

---

Would you like me to explain how to restrict or control this kind of implicit conversion?





Here is the English translation of **slide 18**:

---

### Type Conversion via Constructor

(**continued**)

* **Automatic conversion** can be **restricted** using the `explicit` keyword:

```cpp
class Int {
public:
    explicit Int(int i);
};
```

* Such constructors can only be used for **type conversion** if the conversion is **explicitly stated**:

```cpp
a = b + Int(1);  // Explicit conversion
```

So `Int(1)` must be written out — the compiler will no longer implicitly convert `1` to an `Int`.

---

Would you like to see how `explicit` affects function overloading or template matching?




Here is the English translation of **slide 19**:

---

### Conversion Operator

* Type conversion using a **constructor** is **not suitable** for:

  * Conversion to a **built-in type**, because built-in types **do not have constructors**.
  * Conversion to **older classes** that **cannot be modified**.

* In such cases, we can use **conversion operators**.

If `T` and `X` are types, then the function `X::operator T()` defines conversion from type `X` to type `T`.

* The **return type of a conversion operator is not explicitly specified**, which makes it similar to constructors in that regard.

---

Would you like to see an example of a conversion operator in action (e.g. converting a custom class to `int` or `std::string`)?












Here is the English translation of **slide 20**:

---

### Conversion Operator: Example

```cpp
Int::operator int const() {
    return ival;
}
```

**Explanation:**

* This defines a **conversion operator** that allows an object of type `Int` to be **implicitly converted to an `int`**.
* It returns the internal member `ival`, which is assumed to be of type `int`.
* The `const` at the end means the conversion doesn't modify the object.

📌 **Usage example**:

```cpp
Int x(42);
int a = x;  // Implicitly calls x.operator int()
```

---

Would you like to see how to prevent implicit conversion using `explicit` on conversion operators?

Here’s an expanded explanation of the data structures listed under **"Egész számok halmazait megvalósító adatstruktúrák"** (Data Structures for Representing Sets of Integers):

---

### 🔹 **Keresőfa (Search Tree)**

* Typically implemented as a **binary search tree (BST)**, **AVL tree**, or **red-black tree**.
* **Elements are stored in sorted order**.
* **Search time** is **O(log n)** for balanced trees.

* Example in C++: `std::set<int>`

---

### 🔹 **Hasító tábla (Hash Table)**

* Collision resolution may use chaining or open addressing.
* Example in C++: `std::unordered_set<int>`

---

### 🔹 **Bitvektor (Bit Vector)**

* Represents a set as a sequence of **bits**:

  * Each bit at position `i` indicates whether element `i` is present (1) or not (0).
* **Very fast operations**:

  * Union → bitwise OR (`|`)
  * Intersection → bitwise AND (`&`)
  * Difference → bitwise AND with negation (`& ~`)
* **Extremely memory-efficient** for **dense** sets with small value ranges.
* Not suitable for large ranges or negative values unless offset/mapping is used.
* Example in C++: `boost::dynamic_bitset<>`

---

### 🔹 **Bitekkel hivatkozott halmazok (Bit-Referenced Sets)**

* A **hybrid approach** that combines:

  * A traditional structure (e.g., tree or hash table) to store actual values
  * A **bit vector to reference or cache** presence

Here's an expanded explanation of **slide 28: "Objektumhalmazokat megvalósító adatstruktúrák"** (Data Structures for Representing Sets of Objects):

---

### 🔹 **Keresőfa (Search Tree)**

* Suitable for storing **objects** that can be **ordered**, e.g. strings or custom types with comparison operators (`<`, `>`, etc.).
* Provides **sorted traversal** and efficient lookup.
* Operations like **insert**, **delete**, and **search** take **O(log n)** time (if balanced).
* Common implementation: **Binary Search Tree**, **AVL Tree**, **Red-Black Tree**.
* C++ example: `std::set<std::string>`

---

### 🔹 **Hasító tábla (Hash Table)**

* Stores objects using **hash functions**.
* Lookup, insertion, and deletion in **average O(1)** time.
* Requires a proper hash function and equality operator (`==`) for custom object types.
* Does not preserve order of elements.
* C++ example: `std::unordered_set<std::string>`

---

### 🔹 **Bitvektor (Bit Vector) – Not Suitable**

* Bit vectors work by setting bits at index positions, which implies a **fixed, numerical domain**.
* Since **objects like strings or custom classes don’t map naturally to bit positions**, bit vectors **cannot store arbitrary objects**.
* Therefore, bit vectors are **not usable** for storing general object sets.

---

### 🔹 **Bit Referenced Set**

* A **hybrid structure** combining:

  * A traditional set structure (like tree or hash table) to store actual **object values**.
  * A **bit vector as a cache or reference map**, typically for indexing or fast presence checks (e.g., mapping object hashes or IDs to bits).
* Used when you need both:

  * **Rich object storage**
  * **Fast operations** like presence checking, union via bitwise logic, etc.
* Found in specialized libraries (e.g., **CAPNS** – Computer Aided Process Network Synthesis).

Would you like a comparative summary of all the object set implementations?






Here’s an expanded explanation of **slide 33: "C++ megvalósítás"** (C++ Implementation):

---

### 🔹 **Keresőfa (Search Tree)** → `std::set`

* Part of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).
* Internally implemented as a **balanced binary search tree** (usually a red-black tree).
* Automatically keeps elements **sorted**.
* Operations like insertion, deletion, and search take **O(log n)** time.
* Suitable for scenarios where order matters or duplicate elements should be avoided.

📌 Example:

```cpp
std::set<std::string> names;
names.insert("Alice");
names.insert("Bob");
```

---

### 🔹 **Hasító tábla (Hash Table)** → `std::unordered_set`

* Also part of the STL.
* Stores elements using **hashing**, so no inherent order is maintained.
* Provides **average-case O(1)** time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup.
* Efficient for large datasets where **speed is more important than order**.

📌 Example:

```cpp
std::unordered_set<int> ids;
ids.insert(1001);
ids.insert(1002);
```

---

### 🔹 **Bitvektor (Bit Vector)** → `boost::dynamic_bitset`

* From the **Boost C++ Libraries**, not part of the STL.
* Efficiently represents a set of integers as a sequence of bits.
* Each bit at index `i` represents whether the element `i` is present in the set.
* Ideal for **dense sets** with a known value range and for fast bitwise operations like union and intersection.

📌 Example:

```cpp
#include <boost/dynamic_bitset.hpp>
boost::dynamic_bitset<> flags(10);  // 10-bit set
flags[3] = 1; // mark element 3 as present
```

* Also used in the `smallset` structure of the **CAPNS** library (Computer Aided Process Network Synthesis) for compact and fast set operations on small integer domains.

---

### 🔹 **Bitekkel hivatkozott halmazok (Bit-Referenced Sets)** → `objset` (CAPNS library)

* A specialized **hybrid set structure** combining:

  * General-purpose object storage (like trees or hash tables)
  * Bit-level presence tracking for fast operations
* Implemented in the `objset` module of the **CAPNS** library
* Designed for performance-sensitive domains such as **process network synthesis**, where sets of structured objects must be manipulated efficiently.

📌 Example use case:

```cpp
objset<string> s1, s2;
s1.insert("hydrogen");
s2.insert("oxygen");
auto unionSet = s1 | s2; // bitwise OR-style union
```
